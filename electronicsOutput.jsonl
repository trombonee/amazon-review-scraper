              "reviewTitle": "Huge improvements over the previous Theta, but the V still has some huge limitations that affect its performance",
              "review": "I almost bought Ricoh's previous version of the Theta about a year ago, but where I felt it fell short was the picture quality. Fast-forward to the release of this new 4K version and I knew it was something I needed to at least try. As a preface to my review, I'm a professional photographer and videographer and I also instruct both subjects, so there were lots of ideas and potential uses I had for this device. First, let me start off by highlighting the GOOD things about the Theta V, because unfortunately in my opinion there are far fewer positive things than negative when it comes to this little doodad: - The physical design and footprint of the device is good - it's relatively small and unobtrusive which makes it totally viable for recording a small or private event without being in the way. It does have LEDs when it's on and recording, but in my opinion they are not distracting which is also a good thing. - It's easy to use - when the app connects properly, it's quite simple and straightforward to use. I say when because in my experience with the Theta I've had a lot of connectivity issues in terms of my phone dropping the connection to the camera, even when I'm standing right next to it...but I'll talk more about that when I get to the cons below. - The software is also easy to use - when it comes to importing and converting your files to be compatible in a 360 space, it's as simple and dragging and dropping the original file into the window, selecting where you want the converted file to be saved, and that's pretty much it. There are a couple of other options available as well: one lets you downsample the quality from 4K to HD, and the other lets you choose whether you want the stitching software to \"fix\" the top and bottom of the file...all in all, it's quite easy to use which I was really happy about since sometimes the software you need to operate special camera equipment can be more difficult to figure out than the equipment itself. - The standard tripod mount on the bottom of the Theta makes it compatible with just about any tripod and makes it mountable just about anywhere, and it can also be used handheld, so it's very versatile in that regard. - The battery life seems fairly on-par with the limited internal memory - I'm listing this as a pro because the battery did last long enough for me to record the footage I needed, but if your plan is to use it professionally you may find that both the internal storage and battery life are limiting. - The flat bottom - I'm really glad they made the bottom flat so that you can just stand it up on a flat surface. There might only be specific situations where you could or would want to use it like that, but I'm glad it's at least possible. - One thing I like about the app is that you can view the camera feed output in stitched or unstitched view which is sometimes helpful to be able to switch back and forth so easily. Okay, now onto the BAD things about the Theta V...here we go: - One of the biggest and most frustrating issues with the Theta V, as I see it, is that you lose access to live view through the app while you are recording. So when the camera is setup but not recording, you can see what the camera sees inside the app (in stitched or unstitched view). But as soon as you start recording, live view is no longer available inside the app until you stop recording. I understand that they maybe couldn't have programmed it to have live view while filming, but all I'm saying is that it is a major downside to not be able to see what you're capturing as you're capturing it. This was a huge strike against the Theta V for me. - Due to the file format and how the 360 video files need to be converted before they can work properly in a 360 space, I could not seem to play any of my recordings back through the app. I know you can configure the camera to work as a remote to watch live playback on a television, but frankly this feature is pretty useless in a lot of (most) situations since how often are you going to have access to a TV for playback? Maybe there is a way to watch your recordings in the app, but I couldn't not figure out how. Again, it's a small inconvenience but when you stack it on top of all the other small inconveniences, well...you'll see what my verdict is. - No expandable storage OR exchangeable batteries - if the first two cons I listed weren't dealbreakers for you, this one very well could be. You are limited not only by the internal storage of 19GB (which is not much, especially when it comes to 4K video) but you're also limited to its built-in battery. No, you cannot expand the memory with a MicroSD card once the internal memory is full. No, you cannot purchase extra batteries to be able to continue using the camera after the internal battery dies. In my opinion, these types of limitations are pretty inexcusable in 2017. Even if these were the only two things that they \"fix\" for the next version of the Theta, it would be an immensely more useful device. - Another con is that there are visible stitch lines in certain weather and/or certain lighting situations. Obviously the stitching can't be perfect, so if you're expecting it to be, you're likely going to be disappointed. The way they stitch the videos together is quite good in my opinion and certainly usable, but again, just don't expect it to look perfect. - In my experience, even the picture quality on this 4K Theta seems a little poor. Based on my comparisons with footage shot with the previous version of the Theta the quality is certainly much better, but when you compare it to footage shot with an actual 4K camera it definitely doesn't measure up. Which is to be expected because the thing only costs $500...I would expect a $1,000+ DSLR to produce better quality so this isn't really a surprise, but it was a little disappointing nonetheless that the quality wasn't still a little better than it is. - I do like that Ricoh included a soft pouch for carrying the Theta V, but for the price it would have been nice if they could have also included a simple hardshell case with a soft inner material to protect the lenses. - I've already mentioned the fact that you can't buy extra batteries, but another thing worth mentioning is the battery life. I know I listed it as a pro because for me personally the battery lasted long enough, but like I said above, if you plan on using it professionally I expect that you will feel very limited by the life of the internal battery. - Poor connectivity - in my experience with the Theta V, the wifi range is extremely poor especially outdoors. My phone would drop the connection to the camera if I was moving around, and even when I was standing just a few feet away from the Theta it would still disconnect and none of the app features would work until I reconnected the wifi connection. Again, this is just another inconvenience that, when paired with the rest of them, makes for a frustrating user experience a lot of the time. If the wifi connection wasn't such garbage and you could start/stop recording from a number of feet away (like you should be able to) then it would be so much better. - As easy as the software is to use, it's still kind of a pain that you need special software to convert or play these videos. I understand that is just the nature of the beast of 360 videos, but it's still a con as far as I'm concerned. - Price. Obviously I have no idea what it costs to design or manufacture a device like this, but based on my use and experience with it, I would say that a price tag of around $300-400 would seem much more reasonable, especially given its limitations. In my opinion $500+ is a lot of money to spend on this item which is certainly neat but has some serious and restrictive shortcomings. - In my experience it is ideal to use mounted on a stationary tripod. Not only is the 360 video a bit hard to watch if the camera is also in motion, but the stitching from the software that removes the Theta from the frame becomes really noticeable and weird-looking when the pixels around it are moving. - Very poor dynamic range, especially in low light - I wouldn't expect the low-light performance of any $500 camera to be great, but even with that being said it is quite awful. The dynamic range is much better when there's lots of available light, but if you're shooting in an area that's even slightly dim you will lose almost all of the detail in any dark or shadowy part of the frame. - I would have liked the ability to rotate a recording within the app whether before or after filming. For example, so you could hold the Theta upside down in order to get an extremely low angle. Perhaps this is a feature and I just didn't see it, but I don't think it's possible and I think that a rotation option would make it a lot more versatile. - The total remaining recording time left on your internal memory is hidden in the live view settings - I'm listing this is a con because I think this information should absolutely be displayed on the main app/live view screen, not buried in a menu somewhere. When you're limited to 19GB of internal memory, it becomes extremely important to manage your space and I think that would be much easier if the remaining memory was always visible within the app, just like the battery meter. All in all, the Theta V is a really neat and interesting piece of equipment that does a relatively good job of recording 360 video and audio in a fairly simple way. However, it has some pretty significant limitations that make it impossible for me to be able to justify keeping it. I think that if Ricoh addresses some of these problems for the next version of the Theta, it could be a truly wonderful device that would absolutely have a spot in my camera bag. But for now it feels like something that is almost there but just not quite enough to be worth having at this point in time."

              "review": "As my 360 virtual tour business started taking off, I \"upgraded\" to this camera and though I really wanted to like it, I was very disappointed in the build-quality. The first unit I ordered had one of its lenses misaligned, making half the 360 image blurry, so I had to return it. But once I received the replacement unit and used it on the very first project, I found that it had the same exact problem as the first one. The attached photo, taken in good lighting conditions, illustrates the misalignment of one lens making the whole right-side of the spherical image blurry and as you can see the resolution is not that great either. The only reason I did not give a one-star rating is because of the good dynamic range and decent companion apps."

              "review": "Used this extensively in our European tour. It took very good 360 photos and videos. It fell flat on a cobbled stone road while on a slim tripod, the 2 lenses survived the impact but not the unit. It starts up for a few seconds then a beep and red light goes off then powers off. I am now sending to Ricoh service for a fix under warranty. Not a durable product and I am disappointed."

              "review": "Excellent for non-professional 3D photographers; Image is not as good as I expected.  Ricoh Theta Z1 is probably better to obtain higher image quality. However, it is Overpriced and it can be damaged easily (no protection anti-shock by design, so be extra-cateful!). Here it is my story: After using my new V camera less than 3 weeks, a powerful wind took it down with the tripod; I was lucky as the lens were not damaged. AND, again lucky to avoid a huge repair price provided by the service, and made it work again by myself (I have optoelectrinics background). So far, all works great, the only thing that bothers me is the image quality (obviously depends on the lens) I reccommend the device - it is a wonderful technological work in progress - well done and delightful!"

              "review": "Have been a big fan of Ricoh Theta cameras for some time and have a good experience with 360 media and equipment. Here are the Pro's of the V in my experience, compared with the S and other cams: - 4k video is really good quality and copes with low lighting well (far far better than the Nikon KeyMission). - 4k video can be streamed to youtube via a PC (a driver, currently in beta, is needed to do this but it does it well). - the transfer speeds over wifi are very fast (a big step up over the Theta S) - The app is still really great. - It can be charged with any charger (Theta S would refuse to charge with a high amp usb charger) - Ability to run apps on it seems promising (edit: This is being rolled out soon 2018) - Ability to sense tilt seems promising (edit: now auto stabilises video) - Small deadzone. the lenses are close together, there's very little dead space in the image. - images every 4 seconds with timelapse mode rather than 7 - can stream to a tv that has an amazon firestick. The Cons: - Same image sensor as the Theta S. The camera has a faster processor and you should get less noise on the images, but the resolution is the same. - Image stitching seems worse.. maybe due to the new lens system.. Imagine a firmware update will fix this. (edit: some way to being fixed) - Still no SD Card slot. Don't feel like opening this one up just yet, but all the others have had SD cards hidden inside them.. these have probably been kept hidden as they'd need a fast SD card to work well with 4k video.. perhaps people would complain their card didn't work all the time if they put an access slot in? insta, samsung, mija all have this. - Still has a plastic tripod thread, this was a bit fragile and actually broke on my S. - There's no autostabilistion like on Mija or insta360 cameras, despite it having sensors to do so.. this should at least be able to be applied in post production on the app. (Edit: the autostabilisation now works) - Bit pricey really."

              "review": "Things you need to understand about this camera. 1. It takes 360\u00b0 Spherical images. 2. It does not spin around 3. You need to use two apps. The Ricoh Theta App and the Ricoh Theta+ app. 4. You need to learn how to remove the Nadir. Check YouTube for tutorials on this.  The nadir is the image that remains of the tripod mount you use when you take a picture. 5. You need to learn about Tiny Planets.  These are app made filtered images that are pretty cool.  Again check Instagram this time for examples. 6. Learn how to take images using the self timer function. 7. You will also need a monopod with a tripod base suitable for this camera. The Ricoh one is overpriced.  I bought a carbon fibre one and a separate base. You don\u2019t need one straight away - but as you develop your 360\u00b0 photo taking skills it will be a requirement. Essentially this is the latest model of the Theta family.  (UPDATE MAY2019 THE Z1 IS NOW THE LATEST MODEL) It has a faster processor and offers 4K 360\u00b0 video as well as spherical sound (with added microphone) (UPDATE- I USED THE EXTERNAL MICROPHONE AND IT ADDED NOTHING IMHO - OTHER THAN A WIND NOISE SUPPRESSING FOAM, THERE WAS NO BENEFICIAL INCREASE IN SOUND CLARITY) The theta has the best examples of stitched in camera stitching of all the cameras out there.  For the money you can\u2019t really get  better.  So there\u2019s one reason to get it. The camera uses its in house Wi-fi to connect to your smart phone and you take the photo using the theta app. You can extend the connection by connecting the camera to your home or any router - a feature only V can do. I would also advise getting a silicon skin straight away. Cheap enough to buy. (UPDATE - A SILICON SKIN CREATES A SHADOW IN THE IMAGE, SO BUY A CASE INSTEAD) There is a more technical side to manipulating and displaying 360\u00b0 photos so you do need to do your research otherwise you will be disappointed. However if you\u2019re set on joint the 360\u00b0 revolution (pun intended) this is the best camera you can get for the money. Both the little sister and brothers of this camera the S and the SC are equally good at taking still photos - you just lack the 4K and a few other features.  So if you don\u2019t want to spend \u00a3300+ I would advise getting one of those.  They\u2019re a bit slower due to the processor but they are pretty brilliant too."

This involves downloading the Ricoh app available for iOS or Android, in my case installing a firmware update, and linking the phone and the camera via bluetooth. The camera takes 360 still frames, 360 video and will stream 360 video live. Without the optional, but very expensive, attachable microphone, it still captures sound at a fair quality level using in built microphones. There is a software update which links the camera directly to an Oculus Go headset so that you can review images immediately after capture in a VR environment which is a big bonus. Less positively the battery life of the camera is quite limited, you cannot add additional storage to the camera as there's not memory card port, and it's very easy to get out of bluetooth range in use so you can't press the shutter button remotely from a distance - so there's a danger you end up appearing in all shots. Overall though an easy to use quality camera. Four stars."

Very easy to use with minimal buttons for operation - handy when you have thick scuba gloves on! Slightly annoying there is no memory card slot - I've found that it will record ~45 minutes of footage in 4k before it is full. Battery life seems good however. Also fairly time consuming to get the footage into a usable state to upload to YouTube etc but it's worth it. Stitch lines are there in underwater footage but far less noticeable than I saw with other cameras, Ricoh TW-1 underwater housing also has a visible crescent of the housing at the bottom of the shot but no way around this. As above, the combination of camera and housing was the best I felt I could get for the money. The camera is not as compact as other GoPro style cameras but feels sturdy with good built quality. Certainly not disappointed and will continue to enjoy using it!"

However the stitching on them was never perfect, it was almost impossible to take them in busy places and they take quite a while to take with a Pixel XL. After reading a number of reviews and looking at the Pros and Cons of cameras which were slightly cheaper/more expensive. This one works for me for low light/normal UK weather mainly just taking photos with this. The main negative for me is that the lenses can't be replaced, so if you drop this camera and it's not insured you will have to buy a new one for \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.  I found a silicone sleeve case on Amazon which covers the case and has a removable lens cover. I have had some intermittent issues connecting to the camera wirelessly from my phone."

Die Verarbeitung ist hochwertig, die Optik gut, das Stitching bei Video und Photo wesentlich besser geworden, auch die Geschwindigkeit der \u00dcbertragung auf das Smartphone geht jetzt rasant. Die Klagen, welche hier gef\u00fchrt werden, sind verst\u00e4ndlich aber durchaus nicht immer gerechtfertigt: z. B. mache ich fast immer Serienfotos mit der Intervallfunktion mit  ISO oder Belichtungs Vorwahl. Ich habe die Kamera auf einem sehr handlichen Selfie Stick in der Tasche und kann sie somit schnell bedienen. Nachbearbeitet werden Fotos und Videos auf meinem LG G5 mit diversen Apps von der Retouche bis hin zur Objektentfernung - nur bei Stativaufnahmen. Auch die nicht allein f\u00fcr die Theta V typischen chromatichen Aberrationen, welche gegen\u00fcber der Theta S weniger gravierend sind, werden nachbearbeitet. Erst dann erfolgt das Hochladen auf die ein oder andere Plattform. Insgesamt bin ich mit dieser Kamera sehr zufrieden. Softwareupdates und - Weiterentwicklung sind vom Hersteller in Aussicht gestellt. Klare Kaufempfehlung."

This means that the final viewed quality is a lot less than HD.  Not the fault of teh camera, just a fact of life that there are not enough pixels to go around. Having said that - it is a super easy camera to use, stitching is in real time - no need for any post in that respect which is a huge bonus.  I used NCH VideoPad to edit together a couple of clips without any problem at all. Any people / objects more than about 2 meters away loose definition and as for someone at the other side of the room - forget about it.  This camera is for intimate settings like a small music session, or a group of people chatting. As for me, I'm now waiting for the 180 degree cameras due in 2019.  They have more raw pixels to shoot with and the final image only has to be spread across a hemispheres - by all accounts giving much sharper experience."

Naja, es sollen ja keine Kunstwerke sein, die Kamera ist f\u00fcr Schnappsch\u00fcsse gedacht. Entt\u00e4uscht bin ich von der Bluetooth-Funktion, in die ich gr\u00f6\u00dfere Erwartungen gesteckt h\u00e4tte. V.a. in Kombination mit der iPhone App, hier g\u00e4be es viel Optimierungspotential. Die eigentlich sehr elegante Funktion, via Bluetooth-Verbindung die GPS Position zu \u00fcbertragen, auch wenn die App gerade nicht ge\u00f6ffnet ist (damit man auch mal mit der Kamera direkt ein Foto machen kann, ohne jedes Mal das Handy einzuschalten und die App starten zu m\u00fcssen) kann man im Alltag getrost vergessen, denn die App verbraucht dann unversch\u00e4mt viel Strom (nach wenigen Stunden ist der Akku ganz leer, also ungeeignet f\u00fcr einen Urlaubstag mit gelegentlichen Schnappsch\u00fcssen). Die Geotagging-Funktion der App ist von den Entwicklern offensichtlich nie im realen Einsatz getestet worden. Das Intervall in dem die GPS Position abgefragt wird ist wohl viel zu kurz programmiert, ohne Einflussm\u00f6glichkeit dies zu verl\u00e4ngern um den Stromverbrauch auf ein Ma\u00df zu reduzieren, damit die Funktion nutzbar ist. (M\u00f6chte man den Stromverbrauch der App vorr\u00fcbergehend reduzieren, geht dass nur \u00fcber die Einstellung in der App selbst, diese ist aber nur verf\u00fcgbar wenn die Kamera \u00fcber WLAN verbunden ist, nicht bei Verbindung nur \u00fcber Bluetooth. Sehr umst\u00e4ndlich, und der Weg die stromfressende vermutlich jede Sekunde erfolgende GPS Lokalisierung \u00fcber die iPhone Einstellung zu deaktivieren, um vor\u00fcbergehend den Akkuverbrauch des Smartphones zu reduzieren - ohne nur daf\u00fcr extra die Kamera aus der Tasche zu holen, einzuschalten, WLAN zu aktivieren, dann in der App ins Untermen\u00fc zu gehen... - ist wegen der unsauber bzw. schlecht programmierten App auch zwecklos: Die App zieht auch massig Strom wenn man ihr den Zugriff auf die GPS Position entzieht - sie versucht es wohl sek\u00fcndlich weiter auch wenn sie gar keinen Zugriff auf die GPS Position hat und verheizt den Akku nutzlos weiter). Die zweite eklatante Fehlplanung ist, dass man die Bluetooth Funktion nicht f\u00fcr einen Fernausl\u00f6ser  nutzen kann. D.h. man hat nur folgende M\u00f6glichkeiten: 1. Ausl\u00f6sen an der Kamera -> Daumen/Hand ist immer gigantisch gro\u00df und st\u00f6rend im Bild 2. Ausl\u00f6sen \u00fcber die Smartphone App -> jedes Mal extra Handy aus der Tasche holen, App starten, auf Verbindung warten, und auf jedem Foto hat man das Handy in der Hand (braucht somit auch immer beide H\u00e4nde und hat keine mehr frei -> umst\u00e4ndlich, und l\u00e4stig da eine einh\u00e4ndige Benutzung unm\u00f6glich ist (mit kleinem Kind unterwegs, oder eine Tasche in der Hand ... unm\u00f6glich) 3. Eine \u00fcberteuerte, schwer erh\u00e4ltliche kabelgebundene Fernbedienung von Ricoh -> kabelgebunden? geht\u2019s noch? Wir schreiben das Jahr 2017, nicht 1917! Die Kamera benutzt auch keinen Film mehr... \u00c4rgerlich, da alles an Hardware vorhanden und eingebaut ist, was man f\u00fcr wesentlich elegantere und praktischere L\u00f6sungen brauchte: 4. Einen kleinen billigen Bluetooth-Fernausl\u00f6ser (am besten direkt integriert in einen Selfiestick, den sieht man am Foto nicht und man hat keine skurrile Riesen-Hand formatf\u00fcllend im Foto) direkt via Bluetooth mit der Kamera verbinden 5. Als Notl\u00f6sung (aber immer noch viel besser als die aktuell m\u00f6glichen Varianten 1-3) den Fernausl\u00f6ser mit dem Handy verbinden, und die Theta App w\u00fcrde diesen als Ausl\u00f6ser akzeptieren wie nahezu jede Kamera App. Dann k\u00f6nnte das Handy in der Tasche bleiben, und man br\u00e4uchte nur eine Hand (BT-Ausl\u00f6ser am Griff des Selfie-Stick) 6. \u00dcber die Mikrofon-Buchse ausl\u00f6sen (mit entsprechenden massenhaft verf\u00fcgbaren Selfiesticks, die \u00fcber statt mit Bluetooth \u00fcber die Kopfh\u00f6rerbuchse des Smartphones verbunden werden (praktisch, da kein Akku/Batterie leer werden kann, aber kleines Kabel im Bild) Eigentlich k\u00f6nnten alle Kritikpunkte mit einem kleinen Update der App bzw. der Kamerafirmware behoben werden, dann g\u00e4be es 4 Sterne (1 Abzug wegen der Bildqualit\u00e4t). Ich bezweifle aber, dass Ricoh das machen wird..."

Bei meinem Test habe ich (unfairerweise) das Sigma 15mm Fisheye, die Theta S und die Theta V gegen\u00fcbergestellt (siehe Bildanhang). Das Ergebnis: Nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnen die Thetas bei der Bildqualit\u00e4t nicht mal ann\u00e4hernd mit dem Fisheye Objektiv mithalten. Interessanter f\u00fcr mich ist jedoch, dass sich die Bildqualit\u00e4t der Theta V nicht wirklich von der der Theta S unterscheidet. Die Bilder der V wirken imho etwas nat\u00fcrlich in der Farbgebung, bieten aber bei Sch\u00e4rfe, Rauschen, etc. keine Verbesserung gegen\u00fcber der S. Bei anderen Testsch\u00fcssen h\u00e4tte ich der S sogar eine etwas sch\u00e4rfere Darstellung attestiert. Gibt hier sicher auch kleine Schwankungen innerhalb der Modellreihe. N\u00fcchtern betrachtet logisch. Selbes Objektiv bei selber Aufl\u00f6sung -> hier wurde also wahrscheinlich nur etwas an der internen Bildbearbeitung gefeilt. Videoqualit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr mich uninteressant, da ich die Theta nur f\u00fcr das Erstellen kleiner virtueller Touren im Web brauche. Daf\u00fcr eignet sich die Kamera ganz gut, da das aufw\u00e4ndige Fotografieren mit Nodalpunktadapter mit anschlie\u00dfendem Stitching entf\u00e4llt. F\u00fcr's Web ist die Qualit\u00e4t grunds\u00e4tzlich auch ganz OK, wenn man Abstriche in Kauf nimmt. Fazit: Gutes, einfach bedienbares Ger\u00e4t zum schnellen Panorama-Erstellen. Ein Update von der Theta S lohnt sich f\u00fcr Fotografen aber definitiv nicht."

Di fatti prossimamente vedrete i contro che sono per me molto pi\u00f9 dei pro. Uso dell'App: Appena configurato la camera con il mio Smartphone ho subito notato che si bloccava e dava non pochi problemi di trasmissione dati, ho prontamente aggiornato la camera ma nulla \u00e8 cambiato. Lasciando un uso quasi fastidioso dell'applicazione essendo molto instabile. Qualit\u00e0 Foto/Video: Onestamente dai video visti online tutti ne parlavano bene, io da smartphone vedevo che non era nulla di c'\u00e8 ma immaginando fosse solo una bassa qualit\u00e0 dell'anteprima ho fatto vari test, poi scaricando le immagini e i video nel pc ho visto che era anche peggio. Paragonabili a Smartphone di 5o6anni fa... Grande delusione. Archiviazione: la fotocamera ha solo un archivio interno non espandibile di circa 19gb, che permettono circa 2h di video in fullhd e migliaia di fotografie, unica pecca praticamente \u00e8 molto complesso gestire il file 360, pur essendo un professionista del settore i file hanno un codec che complica ogni cosa anche con pc molto prestanti. Durata: questo come la limitazione dell'archiviazione \u00e8 l'ennesimo tasto dolente, la batteria non si pu\u00f2 cambiare essendo integrata, e ha la durata media di circa 40/50min a secondo degli usi. Inoltre la fotocamera non pu\u00f2 essere ricaricata durante il suo stesso utilizzo, sarebbe stati utilissimo poterlo fare attraverso un powerbank. Pro? \u00e8 molto rubusta ed \u00e8 fornito di un pratico astuccio protettivo. (a mio dispiacere non trovo altro) Conclusioni: non vi consiglio di prenderla almeno che non siete amatori e non avete particolari esigenze di alta qualit\u00e0, io l'avevo presa per sfruttarla a lavoro e per viaggi, l'ho prontamente restituita e prossimamente prender\u00f2 la Insta360 One X, costa 100\u20ac in pi\u00f9 ma ha batterie intercambiabili e alloggiamento per microsd."

Eyes totally visible through the lenses. Pros: - customer service is great - polarized Conclusion: At the end of the day, either spend double the money on the official Oakley replacement lenses, or spend $15-20 on some other brand because these are awful for the money. I have only tested the regular (non-Elite series) lenses. The Elite's may be free from issues but at that price, I would rather just buy the OEM ones."

The originals seem to have better contrast as well as overall less light transmission, with my eyes feeling more relaxed but with a clearer image if that makes any sense.  At this price point, however, I would wholly recommend these, just know that they're not going to be a perfect replacement for the originals."

However, having dropped them a few times, the lenses were a little scratched. I didn't want to throw the sunglasses away and replacement original lenses were about the same price as a new pair of (discounted) sunglasses, so I thought I'd give these Revants a try. I bought the polarising Titanium mirror shield, replacing non-polarising smoke grey lenses. The replacements are a perfect fit (which is the least you should expect given the quality of modern tooling), but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the lenses. They certainly feel light - subjectively lighter than the originals, but that's not to say they feel cheap. The lenses provide at least as much shade as the originals, but are also clearer (potentially due to the build up large and micro-scratches on the older lenses) and have much better contrast than the original (non-polarised) lenses. I was a bit skeptical based on some reviews here, which is why I felt I should leave this review. I couldn't be happier - I hope to get another decade out of my Oakleys and would happily recommend these replacement lenses."

They're good enough for most situations and fit perfectly. But where I find they let me down is coping with e.g. low sun glare on wet roads where they can cause a sort of \"grey out\" effect. My scratched old Oakley lenses dealt with anything and even sharp sunlight didn't distort the overall  clarity, but these are definitely not as good. But if you want cheap replacement lenses for your Oakley frames which are for occasional use then these are fine."

              "review": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Good kit, very straightforward & don't really need instructions (all the parts & values are printed on the boards) and came together quickly.  That said it was missing a couple of parts (one 2.2K resistor and the variable 104 resistor), fortunately I have a well stocked tickle trunk so could still fully assemble. A couple of assembly modifications you may want to consider: -I added a two position terminal block (item inside the white circle in the last picture), it makes it easier/quicker to add the power source when in use.  They're very inexpensive and I add them to all my projects. -I install the 4x8 pin connectors last.  Will install/solder the female connectors first, place the male connectors into the female and THEN dry fit the other board.  Once the two boards are aligned and square then solder the male connectors in place."

              "review": "Bought this as a beginner project kit, I'd never soldered before and didn't really have any past experience or knowledge. The instructions are useless besides trying to squint and follow pictures. The kit doesn't include a battery pack or wires to actually turn on your creation once you're done. I spent 5 hours putting this thing together, I ended up doing a ton of reading online while building this thing because nothing is explained to you in the kit. All in all it was satisfying to turn on my creation after pulling apart an old clipper set to steal it's wiring and battery pack, but it was a very stressful introduction to soldering. For beginners, a project like this would be great, if it had detailed instructions, and for experienced solderers, this is a very basic and pointless project. I'd recommend spending a little bit more money for a better kit. A radio project kit I ordered came in today with full instructions and a booklet that explains the who, what, when, where & why's of soldering. That would have been much better to start with."

Assembly has a few gotchas with orientation of the parts but if you read (look carefully at) the supplied printed instructions (I failed to do that) you should do fine. Definite pros: printed instruction; really cute and daft; cheap! Cons: Power supply not supplied.  We used some USB break-out boards and a couple of short pieces of solid core insulated wire.  If you don't have the USB break-out, you might just cut the end of an unused or broken (device-end) USB cable, find the 0V and 5V wires and solder them in place. Really a lot of fun. Club members had very few problems that weren't the good kind."

              "review": "First and foremost- This kit assembled didn't work for me, but it's entirely my fault.  I rushed through this kit, and I installed the IC's on the incorrect side of the corresponding PCB- so I effectively put the IC's in backwards.  Again, my fault entirely, both PCBs have pretty clear silk screen patterns- which is a bit surprising to me considering how heavily populated they get. So while I can't comment on how this kit functions as a completed unit, I did enjoy putting it together and although the instructions I got were hazy (hazy broken English and hazy from faded printer toner) I never got confused while assembling this. You might be thinking \"Never got confused?  You put the ICs in backwards!\".  Again, I was in a rush.  I was reminded of some Christmas gift business, and rather than simply stop working on this kit and resume at a less busy time, I rushed through it and in my hurry I just threw the ICs on, noting their orientation but not paying attention to the side of the PCB I soldered them to.  A lesson learned that in addition to driving, you should never build electronic devices while distracted I suppose! And touching back on the PCBs, again, they're marked with a easy to read silk screen, and the kit either had just the right amount, or a bit more of the parts needed to make this hourglass.  I have numerous other soldering kits to work on at this time (when I'm not distracted, of course!) but I may buy this again one day and assemble it correctly."

There was no 2.2k resistor, the directions kind of skip around in a weird way. Not very organised in the way they are written. Its a fun kit though in the way that you get to do alot of solder points. I noticed something was wrong with the performance of mine even though i followed the directions to a T, so i looked at the pictures of peoples in the reviews and noticed another guy that did one side of the solder resistors in a different directions than the instructions and his worked perfectly which just further confused me even more. Good practice though i guess..."

This one did not even show how the LED's go in, a first timer might have thought they were non polar and just stuck them all in random ways. Also note it takes 5V but does not include anything (no cable, socket....) you are on your own to have a wire to hook up and find a 5V supply.

              "review": "Just like everyone planning to buy this, I have a flat screen tv to mount on the wall, and wanted a way to run wired behind the wall. In my case, I have a fireplace below the tv, so it wasn't as straight forward as running up and down the wall. And it was on an exterior wall, so I had insulation to deal with. General set up was fine, but ran into an issue with the electrical hookup. Which in my opinion is the most important part! See attached photos. The instructions show push in connectors. The outlets supplied do not have this type of connection. I was able to figure it out, but it left me uneasy since the whole point of this system was the electrical component. Then, because of this, I connected the wires to the outlet, before threading it into the box (back cover). Problem: once the cable is pushed into the back of the outlet, you cannot take them out! Literally says once time use only. So I had to remove the wiring from the wall, thread it into the box from the other side, and re-fish the wire through my wall. I got it done in the end, but had to double check everything several times to feel like I got it right. Everything's done now. And looks decent. Unfortunately, some of my hdmi cables are not long enough to cover the extra distance through the wall, so I'll be ordering longer ones. I bought this at $71.82. It's a little pricey for what it is. And I would have expected a smoother experience. But in the end, things worked out."

              "review": "This is a good solution for running both low voltage (audio and video signals) as well as AC current. Running an AC power cord through a wall from a TV without something like this would be very dangerous as those cords are not rated for being inside a wall. I found installation fairly straight forward but I've got a fair bit of experience. While as their advertising points out you don't need to be an electrician,  you will be responsible for making  AC line voltage connections that if done incorrectly could cause a fire, injure or even kill.  Read and follow the manufacturers directions and you should be fine.  Here are some installation tips that might make it easier. 1. This unit would be best used on an inside wall.  Use on an outside wall especially in a cold climates, will break the vapour barrier which could lead to condensation moisture in the wall. 2. It is very important that you don't cut the openings too close to a wall stud as the cams on the box and the cover-plate need to be able to move to be secured to your wall. 3. Try using small pieces of painters tape to hold the pattern to the wall then trace around with a pencil. 4. Lightly scoring the outline with a sharp razor knife before using the drywall saw can minimize tearing and breaking. 5.  Make sure you are mounting the bottom box low enough where it will be fully concealed by your furniture.  When I did mine I wish I had dropped it a couple of inches and I also forgot to take into account a cross bar that is right in the centre of my component stand meaning my furniture is farther away from the wall than I'd like. 6. Once you are done, you defiantly deserve a beverage of your choosing and some unrestricted binge watching of your favourite show!"

Installation issue concerns screwing into the plastic tabs that affix the switchbox to the drywall,  The crews should be worked into the plastic tab BEFORE trying to install or you will never manage to do it.

              "review": "I think this is a great kit, but I wished the outlet power cord was a couple of feet longer. Nonetheless it is useful if you're hanging your TV and hiding audio cables. I like the product, but knocked off 1 star just because the power cable/wires were not long enough and I had to go out and purchase a longer cable myself.  The power cable in the kit works great if you're power outlet is just below the tv, but if you're hanging above a fireplace as I had to, the cable has to route sideways and then down and the power cable was shy of about 2ft for my set up."

              "review": "I was first-time installing a TV on the wall by myself and went for this model over other less expensive variants because of the claimed simplified installation process. As advertised, the hardest part was to find perfect spot for the installation and avoid the studs, but once we were through that, setting up the plugs themselves took literally around 5 minutes! As a bonus, the finished setup looks very professional, and the wall plates match well the other outlets in the vicinity. Will recommend this to all my friends!"

Cut 2 holes in drywall, hook up electrical connection between the two, pass your other wires and then screw the plates on (built with retaining clips that move into place behind the drywall as you tighten). It was really simple and easy to install. Bonus is you can plug the electrical into a surge protector so whatever you plug into the outlet will be protected."

The missign two stars are for the missing wire connector caps from one of the kits I ordered. The same kit\u2019s faceplate was scuffed and clearly a returned product. Its packaging tape seal was also opened. I did not want to wait for an exchange. Pros: Great product, material strength, instructions, and design. Cons:  Poor quality control; I took unexpected time to the hardware store to buy some wire connector caps."

Connect your TV/Monitor (including tv plug) and mount it to wall < I assume you have a bracket already there 7. Push (or pull from below gently) any excess cable into the wall behind your TV. 8. Mount / connect (NOT THE POWER CORD!) the bottom box - leave excess cable sticking out (i.e.) HDMI/Coax) alone. 9. Connect HDMI etc, to devices, move furniture back and push any excess cable back into the wall at the bottom end. 10. Plug in the power cord to the wall socket, test and you're done!"

Easy to use and the template is spot on. The dry wall cutting could be done with a simple knife, but I used the drywall cutter and it made my life very easy. The electrical bit was great as they colour code everything. Pros: - Sleek and appeal visual design - Install was simple - Electrical setup for dummies Cons: - Minor if any, larger than expected"

              "review": "The install took me about 2 hours and a half. The result is really nice BUT it came after many sweats... The main problem is with the electrical junction box (and my walls). The gray plastic box where you attach the electrical wires together is too deep in my opinion. In fact, it is something like 1,5 times the depth of a regular electrical connection box. In my case, on my 1962 house on a wall that has fiberboard as insulation or vapor barrier behind the gypsum (garage on the other side), I had to be creative. In fact, I had to cut half of the depth of the connection box to make it fit because I didn\u2019t want to make a hole in the board. I also had to cut a bit of the plastic part where you put the HDMI cables because it was also too deep. This product would be perfect for a clean new installation in a new house or one that is heavily renovated... With an existing house of a couple of years, there might be surprises such as the ones I encountered. On a more positive note, this product also fits on thick walls. Mine was about 3/4 of an inch thick and it worked. I easily made 3 HDMI cables and an audio cable pass through without any problem."

Called the company 2 times to ask if this product could be used in this application but never received a call back. In the end I went ahead being very careful to not cut the vapor barrier. Had to push very hard to get the product into the opening due to the insulation. In the end I was able to but it was a bit of a struggle. A slightly less deep product for exterior walls would be ideal."

Make sure you get some oversized vapour barrier housings, like these: https://www.amazon.ca/Globe-Electric-90118-Vapor-Barrier/dp/B00EAR9KNC But then you can't cut an oversized hole in the wall, as the wall plates use the cutout for stability, so you've gotta do some clever work by squeezing it all through the hole, and taping the vapour barrier box in with small pieces of vapour barrier tape. It would be nice if they made the holes in the back of the kit larger, as I can barely manage to get the cables all through.  I got (3) HDMI's, an optical cable, and an ethernet cable through mine."

Just by watching the video I thought that I can finish this relocation myself but I was wrong. So before buying this item make sure to scan the wall to know if there are fire blocks or not!!!!!"

He practically draws only a few lines in a blank paper and wants to use another one and though I know he enjoys that, it makes me sad to waste all those paper. And here's an excellent solution, an LCD writing tablet! Ever since we received this item, my kid is obsessed with this, doodle then erase, and repeats the cycle several times in a day! I might need to buy another one for myself to use. Lol.. I love that we can \"write in color\", and the tablet itself is big and we can write or draw a lot.. I'll probably buy a smaller one for my kid and use this for myself and stick it to the fridge for my reminders. The writing is practically crisp and clear, and the lock-in mode is also great. I use that lock mode to encourage my kid to use all the spot before erasing the doodle. This is a great product, and I can this being used all the time and will last for years. Definitely recommended!"

              "review": "Saw this on a flash deal for $13, decided why not and picked it up for my 2yr old. He instantly loves drawing on it (and demanding we also draw on it) At first I was worried as he kept pressing the clear button a lot but he soon realised that it removes what he's drawing and now only presses it when needed saving the battery life. This drawing tablet is always on but acts like e-ink and only requires electricity when the clear button is pressed, this means it will still be good for power no matter how often he presses that button. Even then the battery is easily replaceable. The screen isn't too scratch resistant so when the little guy was playing outside on it and it got some dirt on it, it then scuffed a little bit but nothing noticeable. The colours are set, so if you draw in one spot it will come out green, another blue etc etc so if your child asks for a certain colour you won't be able to get it unless you choose the specific area of the screen where that colour is. All in all my child loves this, he can throw it around with no worry and then demand I pick it up and \"cuh-wer\""

Thinking of ordering a 2nd one for the kitchen to prep out meal plans for the week, or when I\u2019m making sourdough to perform 6 sets of folds, good to have this to check it off.  Great for when my nephews come over to play tic tac toe, Pictionary etc..."

I emptied out two draws and other places of tangled cables. Great investment I should have got this a long time ago."

So what does a father do when he keeps bugging you for over a week? He buys him the smart watch. This watch is a perfect fit for him. It has games, alarms, and obviously tells the time. He\u2019s loving it and it feels great that it didn\u2019t break the bank so when he does lose it, it won\u2019t hurt so bad. It\u2019s pretty easy to use and he\u2019s got the hang of it down pat now. Great watch for kids."

He did not tested it yet, but I opened the watch, charged it and played with it for a little. Screen responding is great,colors are bright and clear. The watch has multiple watch faces to choose. There are 2 cameras, picture and video quality is as expected. The watch has a speaker, few kids games, flash light, and parental control for games. It is not adult watch, no heart rate or others fitness tracking gadgets but I believe my 7y will love it and it will fulfill his desire to have smart watch. I believe this is a good choice for smaller kid without a phone to connect regular smart watch."

Surprisingly she also really enjoys pushing numbers on the calculator alot and hopefully it helps her begin to learn math! Her favourite feature is the camera and is having a blast taking pictures and videos of everything. It takes decent enough pictures for what it is. The strap seems durable and its great being able to charge it instead of changing batteries. Overall a great gift for a kid to learn and have fun."

I like the tutorial provided since it's detailed and well organized. However, when I tried to implement the ADC module using the PCF8591 chip, the pi could not detect the address of the chip (using I2C communication). Then I found that the chip was not soldered properly. If this issue could be avoided in the future, the product would be better. If the user could not address the issue, they will be really disappointed after wasting lots of time trying to reconnect the wires and change the code. Just my suggestion."

I bought this not to learn electronics (I am already a qualified electronics systems designer) its also not really to learn about programming, again I have been programming for 30+ years now in industry. I bought this to learn about the raspberry pi. It is this that this kit does really well. The manual is very clear (though has the odd word of chinglish in there). The experiments are interesting. But most importantly the manual shows you how the Raspberry pi communicates in Python and C to its GPIO port and external electronics. This is exactly what I was after."

It comes in a 6\" x 9\" plastic case, crammed full of various quality bits and pieces - so full it's like a puzzle to get them all back in! The associated pdf tutorial (available to download on the Freenove website) is almost 300 pages and seems pretty comprehensive, has plenty of very clear colour illustrations of the 'this-goes-there, plug-this-in-here' type to get you started. There are basic informative wiki's on things like LED's, motors and stepper motors, and basic electronics. It also has circuit diagrams, and full listings in both 'c' and Python for the supplied program files, even a how-to on getting a Raspberry Pi going in the first place (but note the Pi is not included). Device datasheets are also provided. That said, I'm not sure it's for a *complete* beginner, if you have been using a Pi for a while and ideally know a little 'c' and/or Python, it would help. And it's fun... I wish I'd had one as a teenager !"

The only fly in the ointment was that the bar led didn't work so presumed it faulty. Contacted Freenove and had a prompt reply and help and are in the process of replacing it for me. There are no labels on the items so takes a bit of working out what is what. I first off started to write the python script in but found that spacing are so critical that it takes quite a bit of messing about altering the script in order to make it run. I have resorted to running their downloaded code which is really easy to get things going but not so good in teaching Python coding. I wholeheartedly recommend this kit for anyone interested in learning small electronic projects using the Raspberry Pi and Python code."

She also learn to set how long she finishes her lunch or dinner because it works to improve her eating time.  She sets the alarm for her until she wake up and stop everyday. She  likes to Play the games in the watch but I will use the parental control function to control the times. It is very valuable because she adopts her good habits and become her slave."

Super easy to figure out also so perfect for young kids. So happy with this purchase I've decided that my younger nephews aer getting one for christmas as well this yearr!

It will hold up to six cords and has 3 small pouches and two large zippered pouches for larger items like chargers.  It lies very flat which is what I wanted for travel.  A nice surprise was that it came with velcro ties - 4 in red, green, blue and yellow.  There is a small slot for a sim card or other small item. The only thing I noticed was that the two inside zippers were flimsy.  One zipper actually pulled apart in the middle as I was inspecting it but I was able to get it back together.  The outside zipper seems fine.  This bag was inexpensive so I am not surprised.  I will keep it because I won't be putting anything too big in those pouches. It is made in China but as long as it does what I need it to I am fine with that."

For one there aren't many sd, microsd or tf card pouches which would have been nice to have considering the USB Drive compartments work like a charm. Overall the size is quite good, the material seems durable, and the zipper does seem sturdy. That being said it will take some time of usage before that will show its weakness. The cable organizer section and battery pouch are actually very good. It took me a while to figure out how they'd like me to use some of the pouches and straps (little to no information sent with it) but that wasn't a big issue in the end of it. Currently, I'd recommend this product."

It fit all my wires for my phone, iPod, gopro, and external battery charger. It fit my usb and SD cards perfectly (none of them ever fell out, which is what i was worried about). I think the best part about this item is the depth of it. I was able to fit my gopro camera case, an external battery charger, gopro battery charger ((for 2 batteries). I then squeezed in my gopro camera right at the front in the pocket. I would definitely recommend buying this product to anyone out there looking for an organizer!"

It also holds my ipad mini no problem.  It does not fit my mac book air charging cord but that is because I have stuffed so much other electronic pieces into it.  I love it.  It is so easy to just pull this bag out when going through security at the airport as well as when getting to my seat on the plane.  Lots of people have asked where I got it since it is so handy to have all this little cords and supplies in one handy place.  You do have to be careful that the elastic will loosen over time so be careful when opening it to make sure nothing has shifted.  Nice and slim and fits in my backpack when travelling."

I tend to have a lot of electronic items on me when I travel and it pretty much fits everything I need although it's not bug enough to also include my laptop cable and power brick or mouse.

              "review": "You have to email the company for a PDF file to get the instructions.  The packaging is ridiculous.  Talk about cramming 10 pounds of crap in a 5 pound bag.  Not to mention when I was opening the box the kit fell from my coffee table to a shag carpet floor and the plastic case shattered like I dropped a Christmas ornament on a concrete floor.  That was a freaking mess.  I had to go buy a little parts case from the hardware store.  So add another $7 to the kit right there. The whole thing is geared toward Arduino learning, but it doesn't come with and Arduino board and the AD on Amazon doesn't really tell you that it doesn't come with an Arduino Board.  Maybe it does tell you, but I do not have 3 hours to research an electronics learning tool.  I personally didn't learn that the whole thing was worthless without the Arduino board until I placed the order and finally received the PDF file.  It also requires an uncommon USB cable to power it up.  I am sure there is a reason for that, but they don't provide the cable or any adapters so you are on a search for an uncommon cable that you have to BUY or rig one up yourself (which is what I did with 2 old cell phone chargers).  I had to cut 2 cords off the cell phone chargers and splice them together.  Sorry Wayin Top, but I do not recommend your product.  Not to mention the shipment got lost in the mail.  I finally got it about 2 weeks after the original delivery date promised. Buy a kit with the Arduino board and instructions included.  This one has been nothing but delay after delay. I had to wait for: Wait for the shipment.  Wait for the PDF email with the instructions (that's freaking ridiculous).  Search for an uncommon power cord or make your own.  Wait for that to come in if you buy it.  Search for an Arduino board.  Pay and wait for the Arduino board.  Who knows what else I will have to search and wait for.  100% disappointed.  This was a gift for my son's birthday.  he is interested in RC, robotics, and drone technology.  The shipment missed his birthday and it wouldn't have mattered anyway because we had no power supply or instructions when it finally did show up."

              "review": "This kit includes a lot of essential components for a low price, but there is a noticeable lack of quality. A few examples: - Some of the jumpers have leftover injection molded pieces hanging on near the ends, so you have to snip those off or else they will get in the way. The jumpers are also quite thin, so thin that my cat chomped one in half with one bite. - The breadboard terminals are often difficult to get connected. Some of them are loose and your wires will accidentally slip out, some are very stiff and you have to use a lot of force to get it to snap in (sometimes bending your component in the process). - The resistors are poorly labelled and the striping system used to determine how many Ohms it has is not the typical system. Besides these issues, it works OK and I like the little box it comes with to keep everything together. The difficulty of the breadboard is really annoying though, so that's the main reason I'm only giving it 3 stars."

Falls apart easily and the inner metal parts get pushed out the bottom because its just paper not even a hard base on the back side. Wires can easily move around in side and short on other rails. And just wiggling the board makes the leds I have set up flicker like crazy. Bad connections over all. Resistors need to be tested individually because they do not match their label. Potentiometer does not work. So if you buy a new breadboard, 555timer and multimeter this is good for the caps LEDs, and wires."

Water feels softer in shower. Rate of hard water scale is diminished, however still getting lime scale build up in electrical kettle. Not as fast as before, but still need to use vinegar to clean it. Manufacturer says to wait three months for full effect. For an inexpensive descaler it seems ok, time will tell. I suspect water that is less hard than mine responds better to the unit. I may still go out and purchase a water softener..... UPDATE Aug 17 2020. I have removed this unit after over a year of service. I really can't see any difference. My hardness ranges between 17 and 21."

In seven days hardness dropped to 160 ppm. Will be coming back to this once a week to tell what changed. Second week brought hardness to 140 ppm. Manual is saying though that unit \"will not affect hardness measured by traditional test\" and with this type of water conditioner the results can be measured by observing changes in scale forming areas. So I'll report any changes as I see them.

              "review": "(Updated to address claims for 1 month and 3 months) I live in a very small house where there is no room for a full house water softener, so I decided to try this descaler. I placed it on my PEX pipe right before it branched off to its various locations, all well within the 50 foot limit, probably within 30 feet. The installation was simple, as others have mentioned. The most difficult part was laying in a small crawlspace while winding the wires around the pipe. Day 1: More lather - This is the first time I've seen lather since I moved here and this was with the first shower after installation. I knew at that moment that the descaler was working. Week 1: Breaking down scale on water heater heating element and water pipes - My water heater is only a year old, but was losing the ability to maintain hot water. After one week, this issue has been fully resolved. No more lukewarm showers. Week 2: Loosening of scale on faucets and showerheads - My faucets are no longer developing stalactites,  and sink drains are not coated with white, crusty film. 1 Month: Less time for water to heat; reduction of scale on showerheads, pipes, and faucets - I see a noticeable reduction in scale on my showerhead and faucets, and have had no need to clean them beyond general cleaning, no more scraping away crust. I've also seen a significant amount of scale come out of the faucets (I remove and check monthly, with the first month resulting in large chunks of scale). 3 Months (I'm addressing just 2 months in since these issues have already been resolved): Disappearance of scale from showerheads; scaly crust in toilets is significantly reduced and no new crust should form - True on both claims. The most amazing was the total disappearance of scaly crust in the toilet, which has been an annoyance since I lived here. It looks brand new now and requires only normal cleaning. I am very pleased and surprised at this simple solution.  This product has resolved a handful of issues that I've had with hard water. Without room to install a water softener, this little gadget has saved the day."

My family was fed up with feeling as if the shampoo never really got out of our hair. I did a ton of research and we don\u2019t have the space for a typical water softener system. So I bought the iSpring ED2000 on Amazon and installed it on the incoming cold water supply under my house. The directions were very straight forward and the whole process was almost too easy. I purposely installed it in a location so I could peek through the crawl space access to make sure the lights are still flickering but that\u2019s about as much maintenance as this thing needs. Amazing! Two weeks after installation, all of the symptoms described above were gone."

I was originally looking at a typical salt-based water softener solution but I was very reluctant to do that since it needs constant attention for adding/maintaining the salt. I decided to risk the ~$150 on this solution just in case it worked as advertised. I've had the device installed for a little more than 90 days now. I have seen a definite reduction in hard water deposits around my sinks and fixtures. But the bigger indication that this thing actually works are the dishes in the dishwasher. Before I installed this I ran the dishwasher and the glasses would all have a \"white\" discoloration from the hard water. It was so bad we had stopped using our dishwasher. I just ran the dishwasher on a few loads of dishes and the glasses came out sparkling clear. They looked like new glasses. I honestly did not actually expect this thing to work very well. But happily, I was wrong so now I have no need in my house for the salt-based water softener, thank goodness. An odd thing is I have an electronic water hardness meter that I bought at the same time I got this unit. I measured the hardness of the water before I installed the unit and I've been measuring it every couple of weeks. I've not seen any significant change in that reading but the end result is the annoying bits of hard water are no longer annoying. It claims the inside of the hot water heater and other systems are getting cleared out too. I don't know if that is truly happening or not but based on other external evidence I am inclined to believe it is working there too. I used to help my mom and dad carry those salt bags to their basement and fill the water softener. I am very glad not to have to do that in my house."

As far as the performance: I have this installed in a ranch with a pretty long run between the supply and the water heater (over 50 feet).  I found a video from a spring that says the effectiveness of the ionization only lasts for about 50 feet.  I wish this information was more clearly presented on Amazon and in their install guide. That being said within a few days I felt like I noticed more particles being worked loose from the pipes and water heater.  No drastic improvement yet but water scales do seem to be more of a powder deposit than a scale (my water is hard due almost entirely to calcium). For the price and what it seems to do I think it is worth it.  Do your research and check the run of your pipes first."

I installed this thing and now it takes days, even a week to form the calcium film on the bottom of the kettle. But even more surprising is it doesn't build up. It even keeps self cleaning and knocking off parts of the film down to bare metal. Very cool. My shower head constantly clogged up and I would use my nails to unclog weekly. Since I installed this over a month ago, not a single hole has clogged up. Best of all, no salt.  I'm going to add more wire to see if I can strengthen its affects."

              "review": "Where I live in So. CA we have really hard water. Per our water report the city water comes in at about 500 TDS. This, of course, leaves white calcium build up all over the shower, appliances, water faucets, etc.  A tried & true solution is a salt-based water softener, however, they are expensive, and our local government has banned them.  Therefore, the only solution is a salt-less system. I looked up a number of high end salt-less systems, but they are $1000+ and seem to have very mixed reviews. As such, I figured at just over $100 the ISpring system seemed like a worthwhile alternative to try out, especially considering their satisfaction guarantee. As such, I went ahead & purchased one & installed it about 6 months ago.  Installation was very easy, just wrap the wires around the incoming water pipe tightly & plug it in.  I also cleaned all the calcium on my faucets & showerheads. Immediately I felt as if the water was a bit softer & the soap a little slicker when showering.  This isn't a huge difference, like a salt system would create, but it does seem that there is a small perceivable difference.  With 6-months under my belt, I can also say that all of my faucet taps & showerheads remain unclogged.  It's hard to say for sure, but I believe before I had this system the small jets on the showerhead would have clogged up well before 6-months after a thorough cleaning. Realizing the system doesn't take any hardness out of the water, but rather, keeps the hardness from adhering to appliances & surfaces is key.  If you don't come into this expecting the results that a salt-system would create, then you'll likely notice the results. In my experience the results aren't enormous, but they do exist & I feel they are worth the relatively small cost of the system."

Almost immediately, I wanted to order that, but since it wasn't available, I opted for this brand. The concept is similar, and I have to say, this one is about $50 cheaper. So almost two weeks in, I have to write this review so this company stays in business and I can buy more when I get another house!!! I love it so much, it does what it says. Now my sinks are spotless without obsessive wiping and cleaning. I like it also that it does not filter out all the necessary elements that is in water as I do not want distilled water.  It is super easy to install, once you figure out the flow of your water. Note: I have copper pipes but be careful if you have old and/lead pipes, this is not for you."

Unless you can get inside your boiler there's no way of knowing for sure the deposits are being released into the water stream.  You would have to wait 5-10 or more years to see if you get more life out of your water tank.  Here in CO we have hard water w/ lots of minerals; my last water heater lasted about 7 years so I still have several years to go to see if this product extends the life of the new boiler. Barring testing water prior to installation and after (which I did not do), how can one tell if this thing is working?  First, the science is there.  I researched quite a bit before purchasing and multiple sources indicate this product does descale minerals from pipes and water tank.  Second, it's hard to be sure but when standing in the shower it does seem the water feels a bit softer on skin.  Rubbing fingers together under a flow of water seems slicker and smoother than prior to installation.  The problem is this could be a psychological effect of \"wanting it to work\"...hard to be certain.  Finally, and most notably for me is how my skin has reacted over time.  CO winter air is beyond dry.  The years I've lived here I need humidifiers constantly running, bottles of lotion used and still would be itchy most of the day.  This winter however there is a noticeable improvement.  My skin is not nearly as dry, I am not using lotion like I was and I do not itch anymore.  For me this is the true indicator that the product is working.  I'm not going to call it 'soft water', but it has the same effect as soft water which is all that matters to me.  For the price this was a good solution and totally worth it."

              "review": "I don't fully understand how this unit accomplishes the separation of calcium and magnesium to minimize and reduce scaling, buts its a great salt-free alternative at a tremendous cost savings if it works as represented. The company offers a very generous warranty for the product and their reviews are exceptional. In my instance, this is one part of a three part system, that has already enabled cleaner and clearer water that my family now has no hesitation drinking. ISpring states that reduction of scaling will become noticeable over a reasonable time duration. I am optimistic that it will and have awarded the stars in advance based somewhat upon their reputation and reported customer service. I will supplement this review if issues occur that change my rating. Edit: IMPORTANT: The instructions that come with the unit have a one page diagram of how to install it. The diagram shows a water flow direction with how to install the wires around a water pipe. In the same manual it states in Placement question one, page 5, \"It does not matter\" which way the water is flowing. In reviewing comments on this site, I see some folks have crossed wires to comport with the installation diagram. THIS was confusing to me and I installed my unit without crossing leads even though my water flow came from the right instead of left as diagrammed--based on the answer to Placement question one, \"that it makes no difference which way the water flows. Today I talked to a customer a service representative who confirmed that water direction doesn't matter, but instructed me that if the water flows from right to left with the unit facing me (opposite as shown in the diagram, which I imagine at least half do, the remedy is to reverse the installation of the leads-- by reversing the direction of the leads. Instead of installing the downstream red wire starting under the pipe; install it going over. Install the upstream blue lead going under the pipe instead of going over. Customer service was cordial from ISpring, but I hope they will include a simple caveat on their installation page informing the above fix. Otherwise, the answer the first placement question on page 5 of their brochure guide should be that it does, or might, matter. I have no opinion as to what crossing the electromagnetic leads will or won't do."

I contacted the company. They said no problem, if light is on, but not moving, it is still working, and refused to replace it? I ask, then wh was it moving in the first place? Got no answer. So, can't really tell if indeed it is functioning without more months of testing. No thanks. Avoid this one. Looks well made, installed easily, fired right up. instruction pretty good. However, for clean installation you need 8-12 cable ties (there were three in the box). And the \"yellow\" wire on mine was blue?? Will update in 30 days. Update: After two months does seem to slow down deposits a bit, but does nothing to remove old ones."

              "review": "We live in a 120m2 apartment in Italy and since completely remodeling it in 2015 (all new plumbing, electrics, the whole works) I have had to descale the faucet filters and shower heads every two weeks. Our plumber installed a magnetic descaler at the inlet to the hot water storage cylinder 18 months ago but this made little difference. This year we decided it was time to find an effective solution and were thinking of a conventional, high-maintenance whole-house system but, due to the limited space available where the supply enters our apartment, knew it would be a challenge. A search on Amazon's Italian site turned up the \"usual suspects\", but I noticed several systems from iSpring so went to their website for more info in english and there discovered the ED2000. This seemed to meet our particular needs but it isn't offered on Amazon Italy so I ordered a unit via Amazon.com, knowing the power supply is 110V but no problem as I have had a 240V-110V step-down transformer for many years. The unit arrived in 3 days (well done Amazon logistics!!), well packed, clearly a quality product from a serious company and was installed the next day. As you can see from the 2nd & 3rd pics, space is extremely tight but with considerable patience I was able to get both cables wound - even if the red isn't perfectly tight. It is now 12 days since the system commenced operation and we have both noticed better hot water pressure with no drop-off over a few days as the faucet filters load up. The shower heads are also much better, with no calcium build-up evident over at all - previously they were starting to block after a week. The ED2000 is the optimum solution for the water composition we have in central-west Italy (1 hour from Rome on the Tyrrhenian Sea). We expect to see continued improvement over time and look forward to many years of decent, soft water. Customer support from iSpring has been outstanding, one of the best I have experienced over many years and countless purchases through Amazon."

Additionally, the calcium/ calcite was not being dissolved by cleaning with CLR. The faucets actually grew teeth out of the spout, and all this from a County wide water service, not a well.  Looked into a \"water softener\" at big box home stores and researched the issue.  Lots of money and time to add salt, sand etc.  Plus, we bought the house with a water softener on it and our PSI at shower head was weak. Removed it and now good flow. So did not want to go that route again. Found this product. Installed it, and now no more hard water stains. A few things.  Follow the instructions and wrap one wire the one way and the other the revers. Then, duct tape them to the pipe.  I then put foam insulation around the whole pipe.  Try and wrap the pipe just as it come into your home.  We were both surprised at this product and have recommended it to friends and co-workers.  Do not know that it makes our skin/ hair softer, makes us sleep better, or is the cure for the heartbreak of Psoriasis, but we no longer have the water spots and the glasses are cleaner.  Enough said."

Our brewed coffee even tasted bad. My hair was dry, frizzy and dull. We got an estimate for a water treatment system including a filter and salt softener for $3500. I started looking into alternatives. I became interested in the descalers for the softening effects on my dishes, laundry, skin and hair, but also for the possibility of reducing the damaging effects of for the last 4 decades of hard untreated water in the old house pipes. Hubby installed it 2 days ago near the well with the box recommended by another reviewer for outdoor install. We Immediately noticed change in the smell and taste. I showered and washed my hair and noticed the soap lathers better. Most impressively, my hair is smooth, soft and shiny! I\u2019m very happy with this product and is low price point."

              "review": "Let me first say that I prepared for this purchase by researching the recommendations the manufacturer had mad before buying it. I knew I needed water within a certain hardness range, <3 ppm iron, and that it would only be good for 50 ft of pipe after the wrap. I tested my water and it was all good so I went ahead and bought it. Luckily, I have two water inlets to my house because one end is an addition. This allowed me to easily install the unit while observing the 50ft pipe rule. I have a total of maybe 30 ft of pipe after the install, with the hot water heater being within 10 feet. Within the first week I noticed that the water felt different and my soap was getting my hands cleaner. I used to wash my hands and have a slick feeling like my hands were oily still (I have oily skin/hands) but I noticed that when I would wash my hands they were very \"sticky\". Not really like I have syrup on my fingers, but if I tried to slide my fingers against each other after washing and drying them, they'd feel more like I washed my hands with something that took off all the oils. This is very anecdotal and not really something you can say is a definitive thing that a person might think is just in my head, so now for the hard evidence. I have a mirror in the shower that I use for shaving. I have to scrub it with gritty toothpaste every time I use it to clean off the deposits. It takes about a week for it to build up to the point that I clean it. Well I installed this after I didn't shave for about 6 weeks and decided to touch up a little after it had been installed for a month. I cleaned off the mirror with toothpaste and got to work. I decided that maybe this could be my test and started checking it weekly to see how it was going. So far the only thing that sticks to the mirror looks like soap scum (I have my bar on a caddy that has a hook below it where the mirror hangs) and I can just wet it and wipe it off. Maybe it's minerals but they aren't sticking to the point that they require anything to remove. Just my hand and water. This is all I wanted from this thing. Reduce the deposits that were difficult to clean/remove and hopefully extend the life of my hot water heater element. I had a brand new hot water tank when we moved into this house, and after 8 months the element was toast and the bottom of the tank was full of deposits that I had a hard time removing (read chisel, vinegar, and many flushes). I have had this installed for about 3 months so it's not been near long enough to tell how it works for the longevity of the hot water heater, but it's worth it for the cleaning hassles with the fixtures. My wife loves it. All in all I'd recommend it 100% if your water meets the requirements or can be conditioned to meet them. Otherwise, I have no idea, but I doubt it'll work outside what the manufacturer says it will. I will be buying another one to install on the other water inlet to the house, which is the one that supplies the kitchen."

We unhooked this water softener and for 3 months have been living with no water softener at all.  I told my husband that we had to do something, as our shower heads had to be replaced and my skin and hair were getting brittle and lackluster. We found the iSpring ED2000 on Amazon and decided to try it in lieu of the expensive (over $4,000) softener we had previously.  We are delighted to say IT WORKS!  I am loving my shower again and my hair is back to soft, shiny manageability!  We can\u2019t believe the savings not just from initial purchase, but no salt to buy, and no maintenance!  I honestly find it works just as well, if not better than a traditional water softener.  I know this one won\u2019t hurt our septic system, and soap and detergents lather better so I can use less.  My laundry is actually cleaner now than before.  This product is well worth the price \u2014 I will never own a conventional water softener again \u2014 wish I had known about this product 6 water softeners ago.  What a racket!

              "review": "I have bought several mini screwdriver set from the internet and by far this one is the best. The handle is made of aluminum alloy with an anti-slip coating which is great compared to the steel plactic handles I bought before.  Those handles can be slippery at times especially when my hand was sweating.  The turncap design is good to have so instead of turning with your wrist you may turn with your fingers as long as you have the turncap fasten with your palm.  That makes your work more efficient when you have many screws to deal with. Included in the set are 48 magnetic S2 tool steel bits which are the jewels of the set.  The bit heads are very tuff and do not chip or strip when you are trying to unscrew a rusted or jammed screws. The bit heads from my other sets had chipped and striped which is very frustrating.  The bits are also magnetic which is great because it makes it so much easier to handle the small screws instead of my fat fingers.  And because the bits are magnetic they seldom fall out of the handle or sleeves."

I was tired to look around d the house/garage to try to find the right screwdriver for every diferent screw so decided to get a set which would cover it all. This set did it for me. Strong enough for what I needed - not just for the laptop but surprisingly for the cell phone as well. Buying all the scredriwer separately would cost much more and this way I have all of them together whenever I need them."

It has a pretty good heft to it. I am kinda worried about scratches on the metal casing though. It seems pretty easy to scuff if it comes in contact with other metal stuff. Also, the closing mechanism is plastic so it seems it might break easily. Mine hasn't showed any problems but it's something to keep in mind. < Usage > The tips are magnetic which is a godsend when building PC's. The number of bits in this set is amazing. You can find just about anything. The tips seem pretty resistant to stripping so that's a plus. < Verdict > If you're in the market for a screwdriver set on the cheap with great set of bits and build quality, this is THE ONE to get. Although it doesn't include accessories like squeegies and pry tools for smartphone repairs, it is still great for everything else. Get it!"

              "review": "I needed a few mini screwdrivers for some repair work including Apple's pentalobe (for MacBook Pro) and a Triwing for a Nintendo switch. Having purchased these types of drivers before and been unsatisfied with poor quality that stripped out or were badly machined I dug around an found this kit which looked nice and had good reviews for quality. I was pleased when it arrived and found all these things to be true. It's a compact case with almost every conceivable bit you could need for electronics repair. The bits themselves are high quality, well machined, accurate and seem very durable. The driver itself is quite small and thin so not the most ergonomic handle but you're not going to be reefing on the torque with tiny fasteners so it's suitable to task. The case is a nice bonus. It's nice and compact and the bits are held in magnetically so easy to remove and store (unlike some blow-moulded cases which you have to struggle with). The driver itself snaps in rather than magnetic. A bonus is the bits have a small magnetic charge which helps hold small screws in place while working. Everything slides into the aluminum sleeve (with plastic endcap) which has a spring loaded 'button' to pop it open. Overall very impressed at getting an entire quality set in a nice case for the price of a few individual screwdrivers. Perfect for home repair jobs."

              "review": "As far as off brand items we've purchased on Amazon goes, this one has to be one of the most surprising yet. For the price, we were just expecting a neat solution to our messy shoe box full of screwdriver odds and ends. We didn't expect it to be so well made and solid. The packaging is non descript, and once you pull out the case you realize this is a keeper - we've happily tossed all our other small bits and this sits neatly in our tool drawer. It's got every small head you could need, and it's cleverly designed so the size in its entirety is no more than 1.5 of my hand size. You push in on the drawer side and the try clicks out, reveling 24 bits on both sides and the driver in the middle. Everything is magnetized so you don't have to worry about everything falling out or anything like that. As mentioned, it feels so solid to the touch and looks like something that will last us a long time."

              "review": "I was very impressed with the build quality and design of this screwdriver set. The magnetic box holds the screw heads nicely in place, but is still easy to remove needed screw head. The case has a sweet click in lock, which ensures the screwdriver and the head holder/plate stays inside the cover even if flipped upside down. One thing i really liked about the screw heads are that they don't easily strip the screw heads thread. I used it on my laptop screws and noticed that the the damage was minimal when i used the wrong screw head. That being said, the screw heads tend to easily wear out, but i prefer that over a damaged screw as those are harder to replace if the head is destroyed, especially in devices with small screw heads like a laptop."

              "review": "The set of bits is great and is well organized and labelled in a nice compact case. The durability is questionable, not great for screws that require some torque to break. Also the magnets that keeps the bit in fell out the second time I used it. Easily fixed with some crazy glue. But the security/proprietary bit selection is fantastic and should get you into any device that would prefer you not open it. My only complaint is the type of steel the bits are made of is brittle, and the magnet falling out after only my second laptop repair proves there is room for improvement in QC.  This type of steal is not THAT BAD, and I have seen it used in tools that were intended for more heavy duty application (including some Gerber Multi Tools, where every bit broke, including the blade). So for the intended use case, I think it's acceptable material, and often I'd rather have a the bit damaged than the screw stripped, so it's a give and take. 5 stars for value for money though."

Hexagonal drivers are not deep enough to accomodate raspberry pi hexagonal posts that have a male end. This is why i bought this kit in the first place so, bummer. I would have expected the driver to act as a ratchet (click-click-click), unfortunatly it is fully 'manual'. Bummer #2. Also, i find the pictures of this set to be misleading because it shows both 'halves' of the box side by side as if it was opening like a 'book' but it's not. They have taken pictures of both the front and the back and put them side-by-side to make it look like it's opening like a book. If i knew this i would not have buy because it is not practical to have to flip it back and forth each time you want to change accessory while working with it."

              "review": "I got this screwdriver set because I realized my current set doesn't have enough bits to be used for everything and I'm the kind of guy that wants to have ALL the bits just in case I ever need it. And oh man, this set is the one to get. One day it just popped up on my Amazon page and when I saw it and saw the price I was shocked at how much value I can get for around $20. So I immediately bought it! When I first opened it I was so impressed by the amount of things it came with. As you can see from the photos it comes with TONS of different bits and even comes with an extension tool that makes the screwdriver longer. And some of the other tools it came with I have no idea what it's for but I'm sure I'll find some use for it when the time comes. I've owned it for about a month now and have used it quite a few times since then. I used it to fix my computer, projector, open cabinets and other things around the house and I can say that this is truly a screwdriver of all trades. Any screw you can think of this screwdriver set has something for it. The only downside is that after using it for a while I can start to feel it breaking apart and getting worned out since it seems like it's made from cheap materials and the built is a bit flimsy. So hopefully it won't break on me anytime soon. Overall, if you use it carefully it will be the only screwdriver set you'll need."

There is a free moving end to rest on your palm and freely rotate the screwdriver which is easily my favourite part of this set. It moves so nicely. The bits came slightly lubricated which is very nice and shows attention to detail. There are more bits than I will probably ever use and they are all very clearly labeled with their size laser etched on each bit. There are clear symbols on the case to indicate the type of bit that is in the slot so it's very easy to find the bit you need. The bits are all held into the case magnetically but are also easy to take out. I love this set and at around $18 I am beyond thrilled. I bought this set to work on my 3d printer, which mostly has hex. I have more than enough sizes for this. This set has made it much easier to work on my 3d printer :)"

It it has two lids on opposite sides. While all the bits are in one side of the box, the screw driver and other tools are in the opposite.

Having said that, most of this precision work is done at very low speeds so it's not really very significant to me, the bits are more important.  This is my only super-precision set, so my needs are quite modest, but with the huge selection of bits I imagine this will be my go-to for delicate work for a long while.  If you use these tools daily, this kit will probably drive you nuts.

The two part clicks together. Cons: - Case - the clicking works well to keep it together however if you shake it hard enough it tends to slide out but no biggie. - Wished the symbols were engraved cause I thought they would wear off overtime but they haven\u2019t after a year so all is good.

              "review": "Having had a 66 piece precision set but not completely satisfied with it, I wanted to pick up a new set with more bits.  This set was a great price and offered far more bits than my previous set.  The bits are easily removed from the case for use, unlike my previous set which required using needle nose pliers in order to get the bit out of the case. The quality also seems to be great and should last for a very long time.  I cannot speak to the other accessories as I have not used them yet, but the screwdriver and bits are worth the price for them alone."

Not on purpose ;-). With this I'm not worried about loosing notes again and I also don't have to run around anymore trying to find a pen and paper to take a quick note. I gave it to my toddler to draw but he lost interest fairly easily since it's not a car he won't really play with anything that's not a car for now. You can see the writing very clearly without any problems and it's also very thin and light which gives it a nice clean look. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for  a reusable note taking or if you have a child that loves to draw. This will save you money on paper and pens!!!!"

It does what it says though and everything is as shown , just expect a light piece of plastic. The pen doesnt hold in the slot and falls out most of the time. But it serves it purpose and we pay just as much for a silly surprise toy so I still prefer to give the kiddo something which is more \"educational\". This is a good way to make writing fun for kids, especially those in JK who can associate learning with fun. Pretty sure this can be beat up a bit also. I purchased for a 4.5 year old."

Hopefully it works for a long time and she gets lots of good use out of it.  I removed a star only because, especially for little hands, it's too easy to lose the stylus.  In our case dropped on the outside deck floor and fell between the slats (no man's land -- no one wants to crawl on their belly under the deck to try to find it in the spider-infested dark).  I think it would be a great solution to attach the stylus to the drawing tablet with a cord.  This would prevent the loss of the stylus.  I'm trying to find something inexpensive to replace the stylus but so far am not having much success."

Great chair, easy to assemble, decent quality, love the blue color design. Shipping was a bit late, but I can mention this was ordered right before COVID-19 caused amazon shipping delays. Unlike some gaming chair this one's armrest do not rotate but its not a necessary feature, very comfy and ergonomic armrest for long gaming sessions, I play 8-10+ hours often."

I also didn't want to spend $500+ for a brand name ergo or gaming chair. This is the perfect middle ground. The chair is comfortable to sit in, fairly adjustable (except arm heights) and at half the price of high end chairs. I no longer get lower back pain at the end of the workday. CONS: Fairly easy to assemble but the instructions could be a bit clearer. The footrest option is a nice touch but it doesn't feel like it's firmly attached to the chair which makes me hesitate to rest the weight of my legs on it."

              "review": "honestly for the lightning deal of $150 CAD the chair is great quality,pretty  comfortable and has more features then others at this price range, finding chairs with padded arm rests is already pretty hard regardless of price, so the fact you get firm memory foam arm rests(covered in a smooth leather) , adjustable/retractable leg rest and  neck /lumbar support pillows is crazy for the price, with all the good comes some bad, i have seen people on here with slightly damaged arm rests, and one person had a rip in the leather  aswell i seen that someone else's arm rest had completely snapped off , this wasn't the case for me, it was on time and came in basically perfect condition (that said i have only had this chair for about 1-2 weeks now, i will update this review if anything happens) my main gripe is the instructions, they are 3 pages long, with about 5 steps, its usable but sorta confusing. i'll give it 4 stars due to the instructions, and the fact some others here have had a few issues i like the chair and it goes very well with my set up, try to snag on lightning deal if possible as for $150 you can't go wrong with this. though even at full price of $200-$210 its still a good deal since it has the features many chairs skimp out at this price range. A clear recommendation from me."

              "review": "We are homeschoolers and use the (name brand) Boogie Board nearly daily for math or just for playing. We've had ours for over a year and it's in rough shape with some scratches on the screen making it a bit of a mess to write on. I ordered two of these so each of my kids had one, but also so we had a spare. Pros: Size - We bought the 10\" and both kids were excited at the extra doodling space Price - I do think with some shopping around I could have gotten cheaper, but with the reviews and cost, it seemed like the least risk for the best price. Battery - They each came with an extra battery, which I appreciate because it's not the kind we usually have on hand. The pen - *Really* snaps in there. It's basically guaranteed to not fall out unintentionally. Cons: Strength -  Without a case, I wouldn't give this one to children under 4. It's not as tough as the Boogie Board, but is still decent if your kids will not be dropping it a lot or storing it under their toys. I'm regretting not buying one with a case. Brightness - While it's not as bright as the Boogie Board, it's still fine. No complaints but is noticeable. The Pen - Didn't come with a string to connect it to the board, which would be fine, but the \"pro\" of it really snapping in, means it kind of flings out when you push it out. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I expect it to meet our needs as my kids are 6 and 8 and will be more gentle. I love having LCD boards on hand to save paper and for quick scratch work."

              "review": "I bought it for my son as we are doing home schooling. He always use to run behind my note but since I bought this for him, he is very happy and always kept himself busy in writing and drawing different things. The size of the tablet is very good that gives extra space to write and draw. It comes with an extra battery that is very good as it is not the one that we usually always have at home. It is very easy to use and gives feeling that you are writing on chalk board without any mess. The best part is that it is not an electronic tablet and there is no fear of radiations that is usually not good for anyone but specially for kids."

              "review": "This LCD Electronic tablet is a great gift for my kid. She just started to learn writing and she really enjoys these tablet. This dry erase works very well and it erases  quickly with one button. The pad is good for my kid to improve the handwriting and she keeps over writing to learn new words. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and didn't had any battery life issues. One of the reason for buying this, as it mentioned that it is radiation free and no back light as they are bad for small kids. This tablet pad has super low energy consumption and does not require any charging. It can be used on fridge to take notes, We don't  use it on the fridge though. It comes with a magnet which can be applied on to back to stick it to metal surfaces. Overall this product is easy to use and great for kids learning to write."

              "review": "We were on the hunt for a small, discreet digital photo frame with a IPS high definition screen that didn't break the bank. We also specifically didn't want any branding or designs other than mimicking a traditional photo frame. We originally looked at ones at our local london drugs and best buy and what not, but most of them were either more expensive or just didn't seem to be made well. This so far has checked all those boxes. The build quality feels solid and not economical, and most importantly the screen is rich and vibrant. The viewing angle is wide as we can view it from the sides and it doesn't deviate much. Thus far it has had no issues playing a plethora of formats that've we've put in from photos (we've put in 4 different formats) to music to video (have tried 5 formats). The auto rotate has worked on cue, you would think it's a easy function but some of the previous units we got somehow failed at it. We have it on the desk using the horizontal stand but there are mounting holes if we choose to move it to the wall. There's a remote control included, whether or not we have use for it, but the 32gb micro sd card that come with it sure is a nice bonus. All in all a affordable and well made unit with very good clarity in screen performance. Ps. if you're wondering if it can serve as a standalone movie player - yes it can actually, since it plays video files and outputs sound."

But now, the second picture frame has also started freezing, 1 day after my having received it. I am not happy. Dirk"

It comes with a stand and remote and the cable which is long enough to reach a good distance. I really enjoy how it\u2019s a media player as well with the music and slideshow options. You can decide how many pictures you want per screen and it self rotated and pictures which was what attracted me most. This digital photo frame does it all and it even comes with an SD card which was an added bonus. For the price and what you receive, I am beyond happy with it.

Kind of defeats the purpose of having a picture frame to display various pictures if it freezes up all the time! There is no way to contact the seller and there is no web page to go to for downloading a firmware update. Very disappointed. If the seller can solve this problem I will revise my review but otherwise it will stand at a disappointing 1 star review even though it could be so much better."

It was kind of hard to upload photos since they are on my Icloud so then I had to find a laptop that can read the SD card and upload the pics. It's pretty straightforward to use. You can also just use an iPad but this album would always just stay on. I think it is a bit pricey but is a pretty good digital album.

It freezes on the first photo and stays there, even after a factory reset. I made all the files small, they are what is recommended. This was a gift I will have to return. And I will not get another to replace it. Do NOT purchase Kenou."

I like the fact that it comes with a 32 GB microSD with an adapter to SD so no need to buy separate memory. The only thing I find missing is a random feature i.e. it doesn't play the pictures randomly and since it's a picture frame, I think it should have the features of a picture frame before playing music and videos. The build quality of the remote is very low, it feels like a dollar store gadget, I'm not sure how long it will work. I did not try the music nor the movie features so I have no comment on the sound quality."

              "review": "Very disappointing purchase. The first thing I noticed was that the instruction booklet supplied is way out of date. For example, it gives instructions for trying to pair this receiver on android phone using android version 2.0. (Of course today, we are up to version 8). So, how many years have passed since this outdated book that was published? Secondly, it turns out that the receiver itself is not simply plug-and-play, at least on android, but rather requires a separate app to be running at all times on the phone. Of course, using up battery. This so-called helper app, also available on the Google play download, is recommended in the printed manual and also the company's website support section. You would think that at least the online support of the Dual company, could get it together to post an up-to-date instruction manual for this device. But no, it has the exact same PDF version manual which I received, referring to android version 2. Next, on the support website, under this device, it says one must download the helper app from the Google play store. It provides a link. However, clicking on the link, produces a \"page not found\" error message. So again, I believe there are plenty of indications that the Dual company is not supporting this device by any stretch of imagination. Next, when I manually went to the Google play store and examined the app called Skype Pro GPS,, the reviews are horrible. Nobody likes it. Complaints include freezing locking or crashing of the app, inability to connect devices, etc. Am I seeing a trend here? I think so. Next, I could not get this XGSP150A device to connect to my top of the line android phone (Samsung Galaxy S9+). The device was recognized by Bluetooth and paired, but regardless could not  connect. I also noted a number of Amazon reviews, perhaps mainly by pilots I think, who also complained the receiver has sometimes \u201cdisconnected\u201d without warning.  So, what the heck use is a GPS device that you can\u2019t rely on?  Forget it! I spent a good deal of time googling methods for getting this device to work, but, aside from seeing a fair amount of complaints from people who gave up trying and were unsuccessful, the few suggestions I was able to find did not work on my phone. So, here again we have an extra hour wasted of my time. I emailed the company on a Friday, and I do not expect to hear from them at least until next week. Which doesn't do anything for my weekend plans for using this device. So, to make a long story short, I have returned this device for Amazon refund. If you need a GPS device, I would suggest you get something else that is a dedicated GPS device, perhaps a Garmin. But not this \u201cDual XGPS150A\u201d !!!"

However, it came shipped with the old firmware and upgrading the firmware is impossible. At the current frequency (3Hz) it makes it only slightly more precise than my phone GPS. There seems to be a problem with the required drivers to install the firmware. A problem which I flagged to their customer service which were quick to reply saying it was probably my fault (even though there are quite a lot of forums describing problems with the installation of the Prolific 2303 drivers need to recognize the XGPS). I replied with a very detailed e-mail outlining my steps (on 3 different machines, Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows XP) and I have yet to get a reply. Sent a reminder a week ago without any luck. With the right firmware this would be easily a 5-star product. Very well built and easy to use with the exception of the firmware updates. EDIT: Seems customer service woke up. I will be shipping my GPS back to get one with the proper firmware!"

This marginally improved GPS navigation but Sygic and CoPilot still jumped around and seemed to get \"lost\" sometimes. Even though I had mock locations enabled, I wasn't sure that it was working properly. Whenever I launched my navigation app, the GPS icon would still show up in the notification bar on my phone. I suspected I wasn't getting true guidance from the XGPS150A. After a week or so, I switched to Bluetooth GPS to link with the XGPS150A. Navigation was much more smooth with this setup and didn't seem to get \"lost\". Also, the GPS icon was not visible in the notification bar, which tells me that the phone was not using the built-in GPS, but only the XGPS150A. Much better to use Bluetooth GPS and not the Skyhawk app."

              "review": "We used to use our phones as GPS units, as we both have smart phones with inbuilt GPS devices. They work quite well, and we had few problems with using them in this way - however the accuracy was not always particularly good, especially when in a city or driving on tree-lined roads. This also made our hobby difficult, as we are avid geocachers. A lot of the time, this requires a good GPS signal, even under tree cover. With our phones consistently getting lost under tree-cover, this made finding the caches much more difficult. When we decided to start placing our own caches, having a VERY accurate device was a must - but I didn't want to splash out on a hand-held GPS device that would be little to no use in the car. This bluetooth GPS has completely revolutionised our geocaching and driving! Not only does it increase the battery life on our phones by about 4x (as the GPS on phones absorb battery!) but when it's on and connected, it generally can locate us to less than a meter, even under tree cover, and in built-up areas! If you are trying to connect to anything which isn't an iPhone (we use our Android phones) - there is a little switch on the side which enables you to set it into the non-Apple mode. I recommend the 'Bluetooth GPS' app on the Play Store - but you will have to set the \"Use Insecure Connection\" to on. Once this is done, click connect and you'll be running! The unit also comes with a plethora of useful additions, including a rubber dashboard mount, an elasticated wrist strap, a USB charger and a very sturdy car charger. Very highly recommended."

I keep the receiver inside the cabin of my boat, where it has no trouble pickling up satellites, and the iPad happily sits in the cockpit telling me where I am. Perfect. I have to praise the seller too. My first unit inexplicably failed after 11 months of use - it was replaced the next day without any problems.

Once you have paid though it\u2019s pretty much all good news. The device is sensitive and pairs easily with my iPad. Even indoors (tested upstairs) it quickly acquires a full set of satellites. Dual\u2019s free app (available from iTunes store) works fine, showing the satellite signal strength along with position, position confidence, altitude, speed and battery condition. The battery lasts for about 8 hours and takes about 3 hours to recharge via the USB connector provided. This GPS receiver works with all the maps I have tested it with but beware that some (such as Google maps) need to stream data via internet. A wifi-only iPad cannot do this. However \u2013 usually for more money! - there are plenty of downloadable maps available (eg TomTom and nautical charts), which mostly come with an app to provide other navigational information. My XGPS150A came with a 12V car charger, non-slip rubber dashboard holder and some carrying straps. It is well-made and does what I wanted."

They fit great, looked awesome, shiny and new, until I put them in the dishwasher for the first time. Now they are discoloured and look worse than the old, grease-filled ones. I would have cleaned them another way if I had known they would tarnish so badly in the dishwasher. So, don't believe the description like I did, and make sure to clean them with a degreaser spray and not in the dishwasher!"

              "review": "I had one of these kits in the early 90s as a kid and absolutely loved it. It also led me into a pretty decent career path where I work for a good company with good pay. I got this set for my 3 and 5yr old nieces and in about a week they have managed to put together about 8 of the circuits, including the AM radio transmitter. This kit has taught the 5 year old how to wire things according to the diagrams and always go over all the connections a 2nd time before she connects the battery, and so far everything has worked first time for them. Great way to help start the kiddos early and make sure we have a next generation of electronics engineers to keep the world going."

It has nice projects and it explains it very well. I like the 1.5 v and 9-volt battery tester the most Unique."

A quick check with a meter revealed that the battery had been connected to the wrong terminals (polarity of battery reversed).  Easily compensated if you are experienced, but it confused the youngster that he could not follow the diagrams for any of the projects but always had to swap the connections to the battery terminals.  Very shoddy quality control!!!  I have a feeling that one of the electrolytic capacitors was also reversed - if not then it was very leaky which made the bistable circuits unreliable."

When I tried other methods of cleaning it the fingerprint just got worse and spread. I tried to take it to the Apple store but they could not figure out how to clean the screen and made it worse. I thought I would buy this cloth since it was close to 5$. I bought two since after reading reviews I wanted to use one cloth as my dry and one as a wet cloth. I turned off my laptop and let it sit for an hour. After I used the dry cloth to wipe my laptop. Sprayed water on the 2nd cloth and wiped my laptop and then used the dry cloth again. The fingerprint along with the rest of the smudges were gone. I really like it and think it is worth the money."

It cleans my TVs easily and perfectly. I just glide the cloth over the screen, and it takes EVERYTHING OFF (even puppy nose marks, husband finger prints, and sneeze spots!) The best part is that it does this with NO water! This cloth, dry, leaves my TV screens impeccable. This cloth actually grabs and holds all of the dust that it picks up - no pushing dirt around. And because it's dry, no risk of damaging my electronics. This cloth works great for cell phones, lap top and tablet screens as well. Completely streak free finish. I love being able to clean my screens without chemicals. I also love that I pop this cloth in the wash, hang it up to dry, and it's ready go go again. Chemical free, eco friendly, great results. I will be purchasing more  of these cloths to put into stockings for my extended family at Christmas. Every home needs one! I'm happy with this purchase, I feel it was $5 well spent. This cloth will last years!"

              "review": "This is the Perfect Keurig Machine when counter space is limited. We have a full size Keurig K50 machine at home however the kitchen at our lake cabin is a lot smaller and counter space is at a premium. This Keurig K35 machine is about the same depth as the K50 machine but 30% narrower.  The water reservoir is at the back of the K35 machine instead of the size and is smaller.  You get two full large cups of your favorite beverage before needed to refill the reservoir. If you're having company and need to make several cups of coffee at a time then the full sized Keurig K50 machine is probably a better choice since you will not have to refill the reservoir as often.  If you have a small kitchen and only need to make one or two cups of coffee in the morning and occasionally throughout the day or evening this compact K35 would do the job while saving you counter space.  Other places where the smaller K35 would work best .... apartments, campers, trailers, cottages and anybody who only drinks a couple of cups a coffee a day. Take a look at the pictures.  The Keuring K35 machine similar in size to a large roll of paper towel. Compact Size with Full Size Performance  ...  Highly Recommend."

I never use filtered water in my keurig, but I do clean with out with a vinegar+filtered-water solution every 3 months. After over a year, the machine still works great, though it is noisier than when I first got it. I absolutely love this coffee machine! A regular sized Keurig is too big for my counter. This coffee machine makes great tasting coffee super quickly. This one makes coffee that is plenty hot enough for everyone. I love hot coffee so this compact machine perfect for me (my boyfriend doesn't so he actually has to wait for his to cool down!) Some people complained about plastic taste even after running hot water through the machine. What people don't realise, though is that you should take the reservoir out and wash it thoroughly before running hot water through the machine. I did this and had no taste issues."

However I was quick to wash the reservoir out with dish liquid, as one previous reviewer had suggested, since there were many complaints that there was a plastic taste.  (Post production grit cannot just be rinsed off - you have to wash it, like you'd wash any dishes.)  I've had a bad experience with a much earlier Keurig model that did not brew hot coffee.  I need my coffee hot, and this is more than sufficient.  I think a hundred bucks is steep for a coffee maker, but as compared to other Keurig models, it was the best price for one that had such high reviews.  The reservoir is a bit of a pain in the arse, being located on the back.  I can't take it in and out to refill very easily, like I could with my old Keurig that had a reservoir on the side, so I have to refill it from glasses of water - but not a deal-breaker.  All in all, happy with my purchase."

Overall, this is great for a couple as the reservoir is really only good enough for 2 big cups of coffee before you'd need to refill it."

I have had to buy at least 4 or 5 Keurigs in the past 5 years - they do not last long, but I love the idea of having a fresh cup of coffee each time... It seems to me that Keurig purposely changes their machines so that you can not use parts/filters from previous ones. They just want to make money, not satisfy the public.

It has a couple of improvements that I like - it heats up faster than the predecessor. Also, I like that once I drop the K-Cup in, I can select my brew size while it's heating up. The water tank is a bit smaller than my previous Keurig, but I've just learned to fill  a separate jug with water to lower the number of times I have to go fill up the tank. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase."

If it was given a metal handle then it would be much better."

I did find it difficult to actually get it connected to my phone at times, and I had some issues occasionally in some games with delayed input and sometimes the controller would completely stop working.  This could all be my phone, and I've had it work great for me sometimes as well, so who knows."

When you open it it just gives you some controller mapping options and a list of the games you want to use it for. But you can usually do the same thing Inside games with controller support. The instructions that some with it are meh. Basically, the main things to know is; Bluetooth (flashing buttons = connecting, solid button = connected); pressing the battery button beside the charging LED will display your charge level; and the flashing battery LED means it's plugged in. It won't tell you if it's done charging. Still don't know what A and B mean on the Off Switch. Highly recommend for Android gamers."

              "review": "I've had the Power A MOGA Pro Power controller for a little over a month and thus far I've been pretty happy with it. First the bad stuff; I've had some issues with the controller pairing with my phone (OnePlus 6) and for some reason when I turn the controller on by flipping the switch to the left, the A side, it won't pair. But when I flip it right, the B side, it works fine. It also seems to sometimes have problems pairing to my phone. But that's not often. The controller also feels a tiny bit too wide, but it's such a minor complaint. The good is it's a pretty quality build. The buttons, triggers, analog sticks and d-pad all feel good. I'm actually surprised by how good the buttons feel; they're not quite at an Xbox One controllers level of comfort and quality but it's close. I'm using it right now to play Hexen and Doom on an N64 emulator and it's fantastic. Everything is responsive and buttons map to the emulator without issue. The built in battery is without a doubt worth the higher price. Charging your phone from the controller is great. It won't charge it super fast, but it gets the job done. I was skeptical when I first decided to buy this controller, but I'm very satisfied with it. If you're like me and mostly just want to use it for emulators I think it's a great choice. It works well with the GC emulator; N64, PS1, all work great. If it didn't have the pairing issues I probably would have given this a 5 star, but it's pretty close to it."

              "review": "I bought this controller in 2016 and only played with it a couple times until recently, when I started using it for 3-4 hours a week, but after about 2-3 weeks the left joystick started going. It was sending inputs to my device as if pressed to the right. According to someone on the internet, making circles with it and turning off and on the controller would fix it, which it did, but only for a couple minutes. This issue makes it unusable as characters or cars in game keep going right when the joystick is centered. The warranty was still valid so I contacted support through their website on multiple occasions but they never got back to me. There is no phone number that I can find to call them so I'm out of luck. I can't tell if I simply got a bad unit as this looked like a quality product at first, but one thing it for sure it's worth nothing now if I can't even get a repair or replacement under warranty. Instead of this product, I bought an Xbox One S (bluetooth) controller and a phone holder, both sold on Amazon. And now my controller also works natively on the computer. It's worth noting that the games that will be compatible on Android with the Xbox controller versus the Moga may vary... and phones as well, but I've personally been using it to play computer games over the Steam Link application and that works beautifully."

              "review": "Have used this a little bit over the past few months, I'm not much of a portable gamer but I wanted something for when I'm going to be away from my other games for a while.  Can't give a durability report, but in terms of comfort and functionality I can say it's quite good.  The Moga App is basically useless for anything other than connecting in Mode A, hence -1 star, but the controller itself is great. I use it on a big Moto X Play phone and the holder accommodates it with ease and holds it snugly.  Buttons all feel great, and battery life seems good (haven't tried charging my phone with the controller, since my phone requires a lot of juice from the wall adapter).  Controller is very comfortable in the hands if you like Xbox 360 controllers. Last but not least, game compatibility is hit and miss, which is to be expected on Android.  Many games will work in Mode B because it either naturally accepts it, or controls can be reassigned in game menus, example: Modern Combat 5.  Mode A will work in some games, but without Moga App support, 90% of the time you'll be using Mode B  (HID).  Mode B doesn't require the Moga App at all, just hooks up with Bluetooth.  Mode A requires the app, otherwise I wouldn't have it. Overall, I recommend this product, it's great for retro / entry level / casual Android gamers like me who hate getting stuck with touchscreens and cramped hands.  By the way Moga, thanks for adding Mode B!"

D-pad doesn't pop as much as I'd like, but it still works well. There seems to be a tiny bit of input lag when I have wifi on, but turned off it seems a tiny bit better. It's overall not really noticeable unless you are trying to play on a tv that it itself has input lag. The lag is not necessarily the controller's fault, though. One gripe I have with this controller, and the reason for it losing a star, is that the flip-up latch that holds the phone isn't as stable as I'd like. It will occasionally fall; my phone's weight with case on is heavy enough that it will cause it to fold onto my fingers while playing. This happens regularly if I tilt the controller toward me too far, or I am playing on my back. If there was a way to lock it in place it would be perfect."

              "review": "This controller is fantastic! I always loved the Xbox 360/One controller design (which this clearly emulates) so it feels very natural to use. I use it in conjunction with my Samsung Galaxy S7 to play emulators, as well as playing games like Minecraft in virtual reality with my Gear VR. The aforementioned ease of use is especially important in VR when you can't easily look down at the controller (without removing the headset)! The controller itself has all the buttons you'd expect, even including L3 and R3 (ie: the analog sticks click in to act as a button). The buttons and d-pad feel rather 'clicky', which is a double edged sword; it's nice to have the tactile response, but in practice it can be a little loud when the action gets heated. The analog sticks are excellent, and the triggers, while just a shade less satisfying than the Xbox versions, are responsive and have a nice amount of 'travel'. The battery is huge, and still shows full charge after I've used the controller for quite a few hours. (Full disclosure: I'm still on my first charge, and, while it's a welcome option to have, I haven't yet attempted to charge my phone via the controller battery.) Word to the wise: Never put the controller in 'A' configuration (even though the instructions will tell you otherwise). To the unaware, the controller lets you turn it on in either 'A' or 'B' mode. The former is supposed to be used in conjunction with an app, which has limited support (and, from what I've heard, is no longer being updated). The latter is just a standard Bluetooth controller mode, which has been 100% compatible with everything I've tried. I've seen a lot of people complain about the controller, when all their issues would be resolved if they just used the 'B' configuration. Ultimately, although I initially thought this controller was a bit on the expensive side, I now see it to be worth every penny. Definitely pick it up if you're looking for console-quality Bluetooth controller."

Works great with my Galaxy S7 and my emulators without needing to use their app. Works also great on my linux laptop with Steam games (tho it needed some configuration on Steam).  Didn't try it on my desktop as I have a wired controller. Great battery life, as a life saver feature where it turns itself off when not used for a time and it can be used as a power bank."

It didn't matter what 3rd party apps I tried to use to get my S7 Edge to recognize the triggers, nothing worked.

This has the edge in my books. It is the size of a PC/console controller and is therefore comfortable. The flip to hold your phone comes in super handy when playing emulator games, etc. The fact you can charge your phone from it is a bonus, making it a 2-for-1 and handy for travelers who get bored in airports. None of the others have these mix of features. Drawbacks: for my taste it's a bit light and I wish it came in more colours. It doesn't fit comfortably in a pocket. Overall assessment - good quality, a has multiple uses, and is a bit cheaper than some alternatives."

It holds the phone firmly, and the battery life is great. Charge times are fine. The build quality is mid range, but solid enough. I'm not a fan of the glossy plastic, and would have liked a more textured / softer grip, but ergonomics are also fine. I've had problems with mappings, and analogues behaving like digital pads. Overall it works, but requires some effort."

I only had 1 day to break them in, and I was concerned they'd be uncomfortable after a few hours on my feet. I was very pleased that my feet were fine every day I wore them. They have lots of cushion in the soles. Fit was as expected. I will update this if they show signs of poor durability, but so far they look like new. Update January 2020: I have had these shoes for more than 1 year now. I wear them to work about twice per week.  They look almost new.  Admittedly, I am in an office environment and I am sitting most of the day.  But I have had no complaints about durability.  And they are still very comfortable."

After several days of using it, it expended to the right size. I guess I just need to loosen the shoe's materials. Update: 2018.09.30 I got the 7.5 M US last year. The first issue was when it was brand new, the shoes were really tight then eventually (may a week of wearing it) it would feel normal. The second problem is about ~9 to10 months of use, the shoes felt it was getting loose. It seems the threading is starting to break. If you step, in a wet ground (not a paddle), you can feel the water is getting into in the shoes. I will give it two stars because once you broke in and before the shoes starting to break, the shoes were comfortable to wear, but it does not last. I work in an office environment and I don't stand or walk a lot during the time I was using this pair of shoes."

The other surprising and disappointing thing is that they have metal in the soles, and if you have TSA PRE, they must be removed at the airport screening. I travel weekly. I can put up with the stiffness, hoping they get better in time - but setting off TSA scanners when you walk through is unacceptable. Who makes shoes, in this day and age with air travel with metal in them? I travelled out with these, and will be 2 weeks away for business. Too much wear to return them. They'll be donated to Goodwill. If Dockers reads these posts - GET WITH THE TIMES. You cannot make shoes, with all the awesome materials available that are this uncomfortable and can't be used for Air Travel unless you take them off."

Arrived very fast, a day ahead of expected arrival! Product as described and very solid. Not a fan of the hanging hook supplied, Not adjustable and hook looks weak for the weight.. Also 1 and only 1 bulb is not working upon arrival and set up. Not thrilled but can't complain much about 1 light bulb out of 100. First try with LED so hope all goes well. Super bright btw."

However, I have not used it through a complete grow cycle, so cannot comment on results. 2019/01/16 - after using this for a couple months, I am skeptical of its value. Compared to my friends LED grow light, this one appears to be a lot more \"blue\" and I question it's suitability for flowering. Also, I bought a quantum PAR meter and the test results are not impressive. I compared it to an HPS grow light and there really is no comparison. The HPS light has much more light power and much more coverage. I already had purchased two BestVA LED lights and I returned the one I could. I'm going with HPS and MH instead."

              "review": "This is a REALLY bright light that seems to be well made and well designed.  The ratio of blue/red/UV and IR bulbs makes good sense based on the research that I've done, and my plants have done well in both vegetative and flowering stages.  The 10w equivalent LEDs are super bright though, and although the light itself runs cool as ice with excellent (and quiet) ventilation fans, it will scorch your plants if you put them too close.  The manual suggests 30\" but I would keep young plants even further away than this and monitor them carefully.  Once you sort out that one detail though, this is a great light."

              "review": "Purchased the light and was excited to use it. When I initially turned it on I remember thinking it's seems slightly blue but figured it's brand new and the LEDs look active. Fast forward 4 weeks after turning it on and I noticed the light was now mostly just blue, put on my glasses and saw only 40% of the LEDs were active. Tried cycling the light from full spectrum to veg, no change, from veg to bloom and no LEDs would turn on. When my light was turned into bloom it would not work at all. So my full spectrum was failing and became a veg only light."

              "review": "I have to give high marks to this companies customer service department. I bought 2 of these 1000 watt lights 1 year ago. About 1 month ago the red lights of one of the lights started flashing on and off constantly. I contacted the company and explained situation. We exchanged a few emails and 2 days after I gave them my address, a replacement light was at my door. The replacement light was also an upgrade that has the veg/bloom switches. Thank you for a grief free replacement process... unlike some other idiots I am currently dealing with. I find the foot print claim of 4.7 x 5.1 feet a little excessive as I am running 2 of these lights in a 5 x 6 space at approx. 18 inches from the plants."

This is a plant light and it will only be successful if it grows plants well. After a month of using this light, it blew me away! The growth my plants put on were absolutely ridiculous, much healthier and faster than I would think. I bought this light as my 2 year old avocado was losing its leaves due to low light (I live in Canada). It nearly died but it put on new growth (seen in the photos above) in just a few weeks! The leaves are so incredibly healthy looking too. I have the top of the plant off set from the center of the light as the light is so bright, it was burning some old leaves. Similarly, I sprouted an acorn indoors and had it under some very old incandescent lights. Moving it to the LEDs, it took off like a rocket! When my plants get bigger and I need more horizontal light, I'll be sure to pick another one of these up!"

Flowering I had to throw in the old 600w hps and take these out just wasn't getting the density I should have been getting (wasn't expecting to to be honest). The in my second run I lost 9 leds in one and 8 leds in the other. tried emailed the company just for a replacement led board and still no response. I have tried to remove on of the leds to replace them and its not very easy to get the old one off. I will be able to get them repaired fairly cheaply my self but don't think they should have failed within the first 2000hrs of use. Do your self a favor if you are looking to buy a cheaper led light get something cob style at least if it breaks its not hard to replace the Cob led No customer service what so ever just keep that in mind if your thinking of buying one Update: this store owner has reached out and replaced the leds free of charge"

In fact i purchased the same light this morning (1200watt instead of 1000 ) because how much i love it. Good deal great value for money.  Actual pull os smaller than expected though so if your growing pot you may need to get higher wattage or an additional light .( hence my second light). Thanks bestVA."

A great light for the value and if you know what your doing with proper humidity, temp and nutrients you can grow amazing plants with 2 to 3 of these in a 4x4x6 grow tent. Does not trip breakers and can even run other brand lights daisy chained! My go to light is Bestva! Love this company and brand! Want to try more models they offer tho!"

Eau de perfume has a higher content perfume oil and sells for a higher price per ounce. The toilette version is wonderful for misting over yourself and covering a larger area resulting in a fresh scent that\u2019s not overwhelming."

              "review": "Needed an electronics organization bag that holds all of my needed cabling and devices on the go. This holds 95% of what I needed it to do, excluding a Bluetooth speaker that is too tall but will fit if you squeeze it in. The three separate storage areas are very versatile and I was pleased with how much I could fit and customize the bottom dividers. I even found room for my Xbox controller with the connected attachment to have its own spot! I would not recommend it for your tablet to go in if you are storing other components with hard or sharp edges. Quality materials I can see lasting a number of years. It is a decent weight with semi-firm walls. It is waterproof for spills and rain on the exterior. The colour is pleasing to the eye as well as the quality of zippers. Having dual zippers on both is a useful feature for ease of access. This is a great value for what you get. The size is easy enough to fit into a backpack or luggage but too big for an average size purse, for reference. My next purchase would only be for something larger with a hard case but that may be venturing into the next price and size category. An excellent fit for your budget, style and electronics+ storage needs!"

Plenty of room for the battery pack, its charger, charging tips and cables. The dividers are velcro, so I just stuck them to the inside of the main compartment along the perimeter and it's still a very nice fit. Could fit a few more cables in the top compartment as well - maybe a small travel USB charger. Fully packed with my battery pack, it's a little large for every-day-carry; but if you knew you were going somewhere you'd need it, the carrying handle makes it an afterthought to grab and toss in the car. Too big for EDC, but very portable, we'll say."

This fabric case has plenty of storage for SD cards, thumbdrives, phones, wifi hotspots, cables, or headphones (if you can fold them flat). One compartment can fit a Samsung S10-sized phone, and another compartment will fit larger phones or tablets, around 8 inches I think. One compartment is configurable, you can modify the layout and sub-compartments by re-arranging the velcro dividers. Important to mention - the velcro dividers are quite sturdy and will prevent the case from being squashed. No, it won't protect you if someone stands on it or puts a 100-pound box on top of it, but it will survive most travel scenarios. This is something that wasn't mentioned in the product descriptions so it exceeded my expectations. Finally, I was extremely surprised to receive it within just a couple of days, this is unheard of in Western Australia, especially during the Xmas rush when the post is always delayed. I don't know how they pulled it off but props to the team for such speedy delivery."

Me ha protegido de manera exitosa cables, mouse, disco duro y en ocasiones un Nintendo 3ds.

Cependant, elle a repris de la forme apr\u00e8s l'avoir rempli. Combin\u00e9 \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de velcro, j'ai pu y ranger et organiser mes c\u00e2bles qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 l'origine fourr\u00e9s dans un tiroir. Mais la taille de la sacoche n'est malgr\u00e9 tout pas suffisante pour tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 ranger. Je pense donc en effet qu'elle est surtout faite pour voyager et pr\u00e9server temporairement son mat\u00e9riel plut\u00f4t que de stocker en  grande quantit\u00e9. Niveau qualit\u00e9, la sacoche semble assez solide, mais je trouve  que les coutures assez irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res, cela n'a pas l'aire de poser de probl\u00e8me sur sa solidit\u00e9, mais peut \u00eatre qu'il pourrait y avoir quelque points faibles dans sa r\u00e9sistance. Je trouve que les fermetures sont assez bien travaill\u00e9es et ne laisse pas pr\u00e9sager de futurs probl\u00e8mes de fermeture. Question esth\u00e9tique, le tissu est assez joli mais parait salissant. Et la forme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la sacoche qui se voudrait carr\u00e9 finit en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 avec un aspect assez \"patato\u00efde\". Mais ces crit\u00e8re sont largement n\u00e9gligeables pour la fonction principale de ce produit. Je vous laisse juger tout \u00e7a par mes photos !"

If you are looking for cable storage/organizer for your home then get the larger size. This one has 7 cable pockets, 5 of which are sized for usb charging cables while 2 are big enough to store larger chargers (like laptop/Nintendo switch) & Ethernet cables. Then there are 3 dedicated pockets for sim card and memory card storage. And many other zipper pockets for storing other necessary traveling stuff like travel plugs & sockets. The only thing that could have made this is even better will be including an additional pocket on the outside of the bag so the more frequently used cable will be readily accessible or maybe a phone sized pocket on the outside so you can quickly stick your phone in there while going through airport security. Overall, a very nice product & in my opinion a must have for every family."

My only complaint is that there is a big obvious logo tag on the outside of the unit advertising that there are electronics inside. I travel a bit overseas, so I like being discrete about what I own so it's a bit of a negative to have a big label you can't remove on the outside of your storage case. It's not like I have much to have stolen but I've also learned that once you start showing labels, logos and images of what look like important electronics or expensive equipment, then you set yourself up as a target. Otherwise, the storage unit is great, I like it and it does what I need it to do ... it feels strong, zipper feels solid and the storage spaces and tie downs work great."

EDIT: The company went to great lengths to sort out this problem for me.  The gesture of reaching out to me on its own is enough to give them 5 stars, let alone the fix that was done to correct the problem.  If I had a need for more products like this, I'd be happy to continue being their customer.  Great job, Bagsmart!  I really appreciate it.  :)"

I bought the blue version so I can find it easily in my suitcase and in darkened hotel rooms.  I only rated it four starts because I feel it is larger than it needs to be.  Having said this, the larger size makes it easier to organize and find the individual cables and adapters.  The case is 7.5 inches by 10 inches.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a pocket on the outside for easy access for phone or the most commonly used charger."

Compartments are just enough to hold plugs and garters to keep the cords from tangling. The USB pockets and other compartments are made of mesh so you can easily see what's inside without having to open it all the time. Zippers are smooth and sturdy enough to hold everything inside without having a hard time opening and closing it even if it's fully packed. Highly recommended!"

It fits many different wires and materials. I found no issue with sliding regular rubber cables or braided cables in between each compartment. Plenty of space for you to bring what you need to keep everything neat and tidy. The bag itself is made of a decent material. It's soft but able to hold a lot of electronics inside. Even with the bag bulging somewhat the zippers still close and hold without bursting. Be careful to stick robust items with corners like credit card sized chargers in the bigger slots as sometimes this makes the liner on the inside tear but is easily repaired with some glue or sewing."

This one does not fit as much, but it's slim profile is perfect for day to day use, and I keep my most frequently used accessories in it. The outer zippers open around far enough that the whole bag can lie flat on the table, allowing for ease of access to all pockets and pouches. There is only one inner pocket with a zipper. I wish the other inner mesh pocket also had a zipper, as small accessories do fall out whenever you open up the bag."

For someone with cables that are braided it can be hard to slide them through, cables that are thicker or braided are harder but my earbuds and micro usb cable for my powerbank fit fine. If they made it a little bigger for some cables or had one or two a bit bigger. also there is three pockets for sd cards. If you carry a camera its a smart idea but it would be better if there was just two one for sd and micro sd. Or maybe a pouch on top for sd cards or coins. I like it because it can hold my 5s you might be able to fit a 6 with no case. it can also hold usb ac adapters i can hold two apple ones and one with two ports i got off amazon. this bag is amazing for carrying everything when traveling but i thinks it more for putting in a bag. i would be nice if they added something to carry it like a Velcro handle that goes over the zipper, it would make holding it easier. But besides somethings that could be added to make it better its a good quality bag a you can add a lot of different things which is nice but it cant hold an tablet or ipad. 9/10"

This Bagsmart weighs 140 grams and has good organization for a good price, although i would recommend their slim bag as that is 1/3 lighter and offers the same features but only if your luggage has wheels. My carry on bag is not on wheels so every gram counts which is why i am returning it. I ended up going with a MEC bag that, although not as good for organization, comes in at 65 grams. Last thing i want is for any bag/packing cube that i use, to be heavier than the actual stuff i carry!"

I was hoping for something to spread the cords out vertically, something that would sit with the laptop in it's compartment.  (This makes it much easier to stow under an airplane seat.)  The bag I want needs to be twice as large and able to hold a laptop charger or two.  I didn't check the dimensions carefully and the item is exactly what I ordered (it is quite handy for the smaller items and cables and I have found it useful) but it isn't exactly what I wanted."

It has lots of places for cords, but it is not big enough for two or three metre (6' to 10') USB cords in all of them.  Fine for a few cords, some memory chips, earbuds and a couple of thin battery banks, but don't expect to put a ten foot cord in every pocket, it really isn't that big, and it isn't that thick - consider the dimensions before choosing this one. Not unhappy. It could use a heavier zipper and a handle would be a nice feature, but overall it is what I asked for, and what I got. Good price. Would be good for lots of things other than USB cords, like Vape equipment, Pens pencils and ink cartridges, a small sketch pad, dry erase marker set if you are a teacher, small shave kit or maybe a makeup kit, small item tool kit, collection of fancy pens, or anything else you can think of."

              "review": "I'm comparing these directly to the Howard Leight by Honeywell Impact Sport Sound Amplification Electronic Earmuff, Classic Green (R-01526) . Wins for the Walker's: 1. The control knob is easier to locate and operate while wearing the headset. That's not to say the Howard Leight set is difficult, just that the Walker's set has a larger, more pronounced knob. 2. The AUX input has a built in cover and is in a slightly superior orientation (towards the bottom of the headset and recessed). 3. The battery door is more obvious/easier to remove. Could be considered a negative, as the Howard Leight battery door has a more affirmative \"click\" when removing. I've not had an issue with either. 4. The headband is thicker and uses superior materials IMO. It uses a neoprene like material as opposed to a faux leather on the Howard Leight set. 5. Thicker pads on the ear cups that seem to seal slightly better. I wear glasses and I prefer the fit of the Walker's. Tight and light (bowchickawowow). 6. Built in mic has metal covers that are flush. The Howard Leight set has foam covers that protrude slightly. 7.The way the Walker's modify incoming sound seems more subtle and natural. The Howard Leight set has a pronounced change in volume. The Walker's also produce less chirping, static, and interference sounds. The advantage in overall ear protection is negligible. 8. The Walker's just look cooler by my taste. Angular and refined, hence the \"Razor\" name. 9. This is anecdotal at best, but I feel I can just throw the Walker's on with less initial adjustment. Wins for the Howard Leight: 1. Noticeably smaller profile while equipped and while folded up for storage. They fit well into a pocket or pack. The weight difference is negligible. 2. The wires from the headband to the ear cups are thicker, shorter, and have superior protection at the connection points. 3. The arms connecting the headband to the cups are ever so slightly beefier. Time will tell if that means stronger. 4. More distinct omni directional reporting. The Walker's are more like natural ears in that both sides hear a sound regardless of direction, but the Howard Leight set makes it way more obvious what direction it actually came from. Walker's are more natural, Howard Leight are more modified. 5. No giant grey brand logo on the headband. They just have a more subtle and traditional appearance. The Walker's are more aggressive stylistically. 6. On most days they are $10 to $20 lower in price without feeling noticeably cheaper. Note: I paid less for the Walker's due to a sale. I'm a marginally above average size male and have shared both sets with larger and smaller men as well as very small women. No one complained about either set, but I think the Walker's were more impressive to most. I believe it's very obvious that Walker's set out to match or exceed the Howard Leight earmuffs in all regards and were successful. If you're a range day tripper or hunter, I'd recommend the Walker's."

However, similar to other reviews, the only negative thing that I have found is that you cannot hear or tell which direction a noise is coming from. All you can tell is that the noise is coming closer to you. Considering that I am using these primarily for duck/ goose hunting, it is a little challenging pin pointing which direction they are flying in from. My way around this is to rest them above my ears and then quickly more them over my ears once I visually see the birds flying in. With all this said, these are a very smart choice for hunters to save our, what, hearing..."

              "review": "I wanted to like these, but caved and sent them back. I simply cannot use them for hunting. The band appears very durable; however, that causes excessive tension on my ears. The padding is simply empty rubber with air in it that gets expelled when they are attached to my head. Thus, no cushion at all. My ears still hurt from using them twice. In regards to sound, they appear to amplify close sounds, while muting distant sounds. Nearly impossible to hear deer walking in the distance. Furthermore, they have a constant white noise like rushing water of a shallow fast-running creek. Very distracting. In regards to hunting, the omni-directional microphones make hunting exceedingly difficult, as every sound sounds like it is in the middle of your head. You will spook deer turning your head trying to find where the sound is coming from. I didn't deduct points for this because it is clearly stated that they are not stereo, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. These ear muffs were supposed to be designed for hunting, hence the color and slim profile. Therefore, the manufacturer should go the distance and make them usable for hunting. My recommendation to people buying these is to purchase them only for sighting in your rifle outdoors if you spend 30 minutes or less doing it. You cannot wear them for more than 30 minutes without excessive ear pain and they are useless for hunting."

I use these for listening to music and other media purposes as well as ear pro.  I did opt for customizing mine a little bit, and I will probably replace the OEM speakers with some higher quality speakers out of a regular set of studio headphones next, as well as replacing the speaker wire with the higher gauge studio quality wire and soldering that in place. I am also adding a 1/4\u201d aux cable with 3.5mm adapters. I have gotten to adding patches and Velcro as well as the headband cover. Eventually I\u2019ll replace the mics if necessary. May do an extended mic project. If I get into it like that I\u2019ll throw it up on YouTube. I am hoping that by over-building this base product, I will have a stout set of ear pro muffs that will last me for many years"

On the range I can hear my spotter but don't go deaf shooting a 300 winmag, 338, or .50 BMG.  In the field hunting, they're a big help.  I have about some pretty significant hearing loss in my right ear, so I'm trying to keep what I have left.  These let me hear better than I can unaided in the timber (direction is a little tricky at first), but I'm protected when things go boom.  They work well enough that I bought an additional set for my girlfriend and I've had a couple buddies ask me for the link to buy their own after borrowing mine."

He said they would even make for great spy wear you can hear what people are saying from great distances. LOL He highly recommends these Walkers Game Ear Razor Slim ear muff's.

Some reviews mentioned the \"seal\" breaking around the pads but I didn't experience that. Like the flat compact size and folding capability. Way better than what I had. 1/12/18 update: had these over a year now and sadly my stars drop to three from five. The muffs function satisfactorily at in & outdoor ranges. Cancelling bangs works fine (tho not as good as older pair of non-electronic) and normal sounds/voices are heard very well. The ear pads are still somewhat stiff even after a year + use and tend to leak noise slightly. My main beef is with customer support! The plastic part that connects the muff assembly to the overhead wire broke and won\u2019t hold the muff tightly to the ear. Called customer support Dec 20 and spent about 45 min ordering replacement part ($12 user install). Recalled support again Jan 10 and they informed me they were out of stock and no estimated restock or shipping date. These parts must break a lot if Walkers is out of stock so should be a manufacturing defect and repaired or part replaced free in my opinion. Almost a month w/o use and counting..."

Would be handy to have around the house for family members who can't quite hear the tv at lower volumes OR if you want to eavesdrop on conversations nearby. Everyone can see that your wearing earphones but probably have no idea that you can hear their conversations clearly. (teeheehee) They do get sweaty after awhile but wipe clean with a wet wipe.

Any background noise tends to fool the circuitry in the muffs and renders them useless.  However..they do as intended.

Outside of travelling, I would use it just for storing cables, USB drive, attachments, Fire TV, iPad Air 2 (fits with protective case) cameras, batteries, Bluetooth mouse etc. Really this is a great bag. One thing that I am confused about is the small  SIM, TF, SD marked area inside the cable part of the bag, there is no way to put any card inside that area, however, even if there was I would not store my sim cards in such a small pocket. I would highly recommend this bag for any form of business travel or organization"

There are two separate outer zippers, but you have to get used to this (I would often unzip the wrong zipper). UPDATE, WITH ONE STAR DEDUCTED (5 stars to 4 stars): I liked the case so much that I bought a second one, this time in pink (to distinguish the two colours). But this pink-colour case has a strong and awful chemical smell, especially in the upper compartment. I wanted to return it, but I am too busy, so I will just let it go."

              "review": "I had a small, desk-side, blue recycling bin that I was using to hold a bunch of electronic parts (travel routers, Apple TV, etc.) and cables that we take out of our trailer when we store it. However, all of the cables get jumbled up so that when you take anything out, half the other things in the bin come out with it. I got tired of that. I went looking for a way to organize these parts and found this travel case. It's perfect. It has lots of places to tuck cables. It also has a larger compartment to hold bigger items like the travel router and the Apple TV. So, everything stays tidy and organized. I'm very happy with this. If I need more space, I can buy bigger versions or two smaller ones. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one."

              "review": "So far this is just a first impressions review, just recieved the product today and transferred all my tech into the bag. Design: the product looks like it is a durable sturdy bag, time will tell how the fabric and zippers hold up with being thrown in and out of bags, I do wish the interior had a bright colour to make things easier to find / Stand out more . Size: this bag is large, simple as that. I recently purchased a different bag that was way to small from bagsmart, so when purchasing this one I wanted to make sure I could fit everything into it. And sure enough I could and then some. I have 3x Anker chargers, 6 heavy duty Anker cables, 3 data sticks, 4x AAA, 4xAA, wired headphones, wireless headphones, USB C Hub, portable SSD, 3 SD cards, 2100mah battery pack, Phone controller, ,Xbox controller, Mousepad (in tablet pouch), Mouse & smart watch charger. Uses: I envision this would be a good bag for people going in a trip who wants to carry everyone's charger in one bag, or as a quick grab Go Pro bag, holds your Hub, batteries, Chargers, Cameras and accessories, I think this bag is a little to big to be carrying around in your backpack all day when you fill it to it's potential, it also takes up a bit too much space in that regard as well. I will come back in a month of use to update this review as needed."

The bag works really well for keeping all cables and plugs organized, plus there are spots for SIM and SD cards.  It is a little bulkier than I would have preferred, but I take advantage of the extra space by putting a book in the bottom compartment, just in case I get tired of screens. The zippers and material seem to be of a decent quality and have held up well after a month of use."

What I mean is with other electronics organizers, the flat panels are hard enough to protect the electronics inside, however the side seems can be compressed. With these, the side panels are as stiff as the flat panels making compression impossible. Placing this inside a suitcase or backpack, the actual backpack is extended outwards because these things will not push down at all.

No detriment to the item itself, which is very useful for a longer trip or more gear. It is however rather bulky so if you're looking simply to keep a couple if cables, a charger and battery pack safe and in order, you might find something smaller more suitable. I can fit in headphones, charging cables for phone, aux lead, battery pack lead and large battery pack, torch, phone charger and socket adapter without problem. The zip isn't amazing but is ok and the hardshell provides some padding for equiptment."

Es dient mir dabei, diese kleinen Utensilien, die f\u00fcr mich als DJ wichtig sind, kompakt zu halten. Das Case ist stabil gebaut und wirkt robust - wie es sich \u00fcber l\u00e4ngere Zeit verh\u00e4lt bleibt abzuwarten. Verarbeitung sieht gut aus und Style ist h\u00fcbsch. Durch die harte Au\u00dfenh\u00fclle ist es schwierig das Case etwas zu \u00fcberladen bzw. zu stopfen. Wenn die Seitenf\u00e4cher voll sind, bleibt kaum Raum, in der Mittelwand noch Dinge, die leicht auftragen unterzubringen, da diese Wand direkt auf dem Rei\u00dfverschluss der tieferen Seitenabteile aufliegt. Meiner Meinung nach h\u00e4tte man das Case minimal dicker gestalten m\u00fcssen, damit zwischen Trennwand und den Seitenabteilen noch etwas Luft ist. Im Prinzip kann ich nur die Seitenf\u00e4cher nutzen. Ich war so schnell an der Kapazit\u00e4tsgrenze und musste etwas quetschen."

              "review": "I can see how some people will find this case too big or bulky. However (for my needs) this is perfect, and most importantly, very protective. The padding is very nice inside as well. I can confidently know that if I accidentally drop this, my stuff will be protected. I also like how they added a hand strap... it has a nice texture to it and it feels very secure to the bag itself (you cannot remove the hand strap, however). Surprisingly, the company\u2019s logo is nowhere to be found on the outer part of the case. Rather, it\u2019s found in a small spot on the inside of the case. This is a small observation, but I can imagine some people will be happy with this decision if they don\u2019t like logos showing. For reference, I have a 21000mAh portable battery bank , 5 charging cables (of various sizes), and a 30W USB-C wall charger. I like how I was able to easily fit these items in this case; I tried to do this with this company\u2019s folding accessories pouch, but it wouldn\u2019t fold properly with all those items inside. The middle flap can be secured with the small velcro strap that\u2019s inside. I actually love this design since I made it so my primary items that I need right away are in plain view right when I open the case. My other stuff that I rarely need is on the other side, where the velcro is securing the flap. In conclusion, I highly recommend this to someone who doesn\u2019t mind a bulky accessories case who wants to make sure their stuff stays protected wherever they go; for someone who doesn\u2019t mind having an all black design who doesn\u2019t need a colorful case. The build quality is really exceptional for the price you\u2019re paying. I can tell that this company took the time to make sure they made a good case that would be great for someone like me. Thank you."

It has a bunch of \"pockets\" for organization, but they really hinder the case from storing more than 3 items.  If the items you are trying to store are thicker than 1/4 inch, and you add more than a few items, the case can't close.  I bought this for an international trip to store and organize all of the A/V stuff we would need for the airplane and it was a bust.  We brought multiple audio splitters and auxiliary batteries -- and the case was overloaded and wouldn't zip.  The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it is a sturdy case.  It will keep those 3 items that actually fit really safe and protected."

It is soft and comfortable and there\u2019s enough grip for our baby to crawl on it. It is also very light and I can easily move from one room to another or to the living room and use the neutral side and no one will even notice it\u2019s meant for children. It seem durable too. Our baby keeps scratching his nails against it and no damage so far. I have tried to scratch it with my nails too and so far so good! Pretty happy with this purchase!"

I can see my baby still playing on the road map print with his own vehicles later on after he's mastered crawling on it. The neutral print side also lets me use it as a substitute for the living room rug. Material is nice and cushioned - my mom slept on this for a few nights when the doctor told her she had to lie on the floor to realign her back, she said it was cushioned enough to sleep on. Note the generous sizing of the mat and make sure you have space for it, I can see this being an issue for those with smaller spaces. This mat takes up a good chunk of my play room. Material is easy to clean, but slippery. You won't slip on it (unless you're running with socks) but my baby is learning to crawl right now and and the lack of grip makes it hard for him to push himself up and forward."

Turns out, even we only put the baby and baby boys on it, for some reason the mat is still broken and it shows the foam inside!!! Also, my baby starts crawling now, his arm is often stuck on the mat because the material creates some sort of suction on bear skin in warm weather, not pleasant. The gray color fades off as well. I took the pictures showing one spot but there are multiple spots. I like it a lot because the looking is very nice but won\u2019t buy it again."

              "review": "I really liked this mat when I first got it. The colours and patterns are super cute and it covers a large area. I needed another mat in a smaller size and bought a baby care mat. The baby care is WAY more cushioned than the skip hop. The skip hop one has basically no cushioning and you can feel to the other side of it easily. The baby care one actually has some sort of layer of cushioning and you cannot feel your fingers through the other side. I wish I had paid a bit more for the bigger baby care mat instead of spending less and getting poor quality. I also have has several squares rip off easily. It\u2019s not the most durable if you have pets."

              "review": "I bought this for my 7 month old granddaughter after our daughter had mentioned that she would like a play mat for the baby to play on  As I have not had to research this item before, I left it up to my daughter to choose and also had a recommendation from a friend of hers.  I like the fact that it rolls up, not folds like an accordian.  We have only had it a couple of weeks and I can honestly say that it is super cute and the sizing is perfect. I can see how it can get damaged from animals or sharp toys rubbing along the mat.  There is no avoiding that unless you keep EVERYTHING off of it - but then what is the point.  So my concern is that, for the price,  I had not expected it to be made in China.  I had gone into a chain store and they sell similar mats, the size is just a tad smaller, also made in China but at less than half price of what this one cost.  Therefore, do your research.  For the amount of time the child is going to be on it - you don't have to spend a fortune because in my mind, they are all very similar."

For the color and pattern design I like this one better. The contrast of the color caught my baby\u2019s attention she loves to look at the pattern and play on the mat. Very happy of the purchase."

It is way cushier than cheaper mats, the images are fun and compliment a modern living space. Having the less \"kid like\" side allows for nicer look if in your living room (which ours is). The size is also great! Big enough for 2 kids and an adult to play on comfortably. I've been using it as a work out spot too and it's been amazing! Baby stuff is expensive, but this is something we use every single day and will continue to use for years (planning to move it into kids room once he's old enough) Worth the money compared to other short-lived expensive baby items!"

All in all this is a good quality kit for a reasonable price. Personally I'm very pleased with the purchase. Thank you."

              "review": "I bought this product so I could listen to music while walking our dog in cold weather.  In most respects, I am delighted. The stereo speakers connect easily to my smart phone via blue tooth, the sound quality is far better than I would have expected given the cost, and the hat is comfortable, warm and, to my mind, stylish. There is however a problem that arises out of the design -  the electronics are housed in a unit that sits in a pouch behind a leatherette square and the controls are operated sight unseen through the leatherette. Since the unit slides around a bit relative to the leatherette, it is hard to know which button you are pushing. it means that getting the unit started and stopped is a hit and miss affair and can take a few minutes. A workaround: plug and unplug the charger cable until the unit starts or stops. Again, I am delighted with my purchase, and would order it again, but don't be surprised by controls that are a bit frustrating."

It is still a little big, so if he pulls it all the way down on his head, the speakers are at his ear lobes, rather than directly on his ears. He also says it is very warm. It's easy to charge.

I'm going to keep stretching out the hat until I get the desired fit but overall these are a neat invention and useful, and the hat is warm."

The sound is similar to holding computer speakers to your head. Pretty loud, so loud in fact I hurt my ear the first time I messed around and stuck one of the speakers on my ear at full blast. Be careful when adjusting sound or you will do what I did. Overall, the beanie seems cool. Just don't do what I did and mess up your ear for a few days."

The only negative is that if he listens a bit too loudly I can hear the music too. I guess that can be a good thing though since unlike earbuds I know when it's too loud and can make him turn it down."

O-ring can come out, though it is not a smooth surface, and could potentially let water in.  I might replace it. Not bad for the price, I guess"

I like to buy quality items and (I know, call me weird) items that are from the same manufacturer that look similar.  After much research I opted for these 2 items.  The drone case is VERY nice and sturdy, it is made out of a nice plastic material.  In contrast, this Osmo Action case is made out of a material that seems very similar to one of the big clear plastic storage totes you can buy at any big box store that seems to last about 6 months before something breaks on it.  Probably not a big deal, but all the photos show the foam removed so you can just put your Osmo Action right in and walk away.  It comes with all foam in place and you have to remove the pieces you need to in order to fit what you want.  I guess this could be a plus for some people, but I was looking for a custom case I could just use right out of the box and not have to worry about removing a piece of foam I wish I wouldn't have.  I am returning this case and will be looking for something a little nicer to protect my investment."
