"Huge improvements over the previous Theta, but the V still has some huge limitations that affect its performance",3.0,"I almost bought Ricoh's previous version of the Theta about a year ago, but where I felt it fell short was the picture quality. Fast-forward to the release of this new 4K version and I knew it was something I needed to at least try. As a preface to my review, I'm a professional photographer and videographer and I also instruct both subjects, so there were lots of ideas and potential uses I had for this device. First, let me start off by highlighting the GOOD things about the Theta V, because unfortunately in my opinion there are far fewer positive things than negative when it comes to this little doodad: - The physical design and footprint of the device is good - it's relatively small and unobtrusive which makes it totally viable for recording a small or private event without being in the way. It does have LEDs when it's on and recording, but in my opinion they are not distracting which is also a good thing. - It's easy to use - when the app connects properly, it's quite simple and straightforward to use. I say when because in my experience with the Theta I've had a lot of connectivity issues in terms of my phone dropping the connection to the camera, even when I'm standing right next to it...but I'll talk more about that when I get to the cons below. - The software is also easy to use - when it comes to importing and converting your files to be compatible in a 360 space, it's as simple and dragging and dropping the original file into the window, selecting where you want the converted file to be saved, and that's pretty much it. There are a couple of other options available as well: one lets you downsample the quality from 4K to HD, and the other lets you choose whether you want the stitching software to ""fix"" the top and bottom of the file...all in all, it's quite easy to use which I was really happy about since sometimes the software you need to operate special camera equipment can be more difficult to figure out than the equipment itself. - The standard tripod mount on the bottom of the Theta makes it compatible with just about any tripod and makes it mountable just about anywhere, and it can also be used handheld, so it's very versatile in that regard. - The battery life seems fairly on-par with the limited internal memory - I'm listing this as a pro because the battery did last long enough for me to record the footage I needed, but if your plan is to use it professionally you may find that both the internal storage and battery life are limiting. - The flat bottom - I'm really glad they made the bottom flat so that you can just stand it up on a flat surface. There might only be specific situations where you could or would want to use it like that, but I'm glad it's at least possible. - One thing I like about the app is that you can view the camera feed output in stitched or unstitched view which is sometimes helpful to be able to switch back and forth so easily. Okay, now onto the BAD things about the Theta V...here we go: - One of the biggest and most frustrating issues with the Theta V, as I see it, is that you lose access to live view through the app while you are recording. So when the camera is setup but not recording, you can see what the camera sees inside the app (in stitched or unstitched view). But as soon as you start recording, live view is no longer available inside the app until you stop recording. I understand that they maybe couldn't have programmed it to have live view while filming, but all I'm saying is that it is a major downside to not be able to see what you're capturing as you're capturing it. This was a huge strike against the Theta V for me. - Due to the file format and how the 360 video files need to be converted before they can work properly in a 360 space, I could not seem to play any of my recordings back through the app. I know you can configure the camera to work as a remote to watch live playback on a television, but frankly this feature is pretty useless in a lot of (most) situations since how often are you going to have access to a TV for playback? Maybe there is a way to watch your recordings in the app, but I couldn't not figure out how. Again, it's a small inconvenience but when you stack it on top of all the other small inconveniences, well...you'll see what my verdict is. - No expandable storage OR exchangeable batteries - if the first two cons I listed weren't dealbreakers for you, this one very well could be. You are limited not only by the internal storage of 19GB (which is not much, especially when it comes to 4K video) but you're also limited to its built-in battery. No, you cannot expand the memory with a MicroSD card once the internal memory is full. No, you cannot purchase extra batteries to be able to continue using the camera after the internal battery dies. In my opinion, these types of limitations are pretty inexcusable in 2017. Even if these were the only two things that they ""fix"" for the next version of the Theta, it would be an immensely more useful device. - Another con is that there are visible stitch lines in certain weather and/or certain lighting situations. Obviously the stitching can't be perfect, so if you're expecting it to be, you're likely going to be disappointed. The way they stitch the videos together is quite good in my opinion and certainly usable, but again, just don't expect it to look perfect. - In my experience, even the picture quality on this 4K Theta seems a little poor. Based on my comparisons with footage shot with the previous version of the Theta the quality is certainly much better, but when you compare it to footage shot with an actual 4K camera it definitely doesn't measure up. Which is to be expected because the thing only costs $500...I would expect a $1,000+ DSLR to produce better quality so this isn't really a surprise, but it was a little disappointing nonetheless that the quality wasn't still a little better than it is. - I do like that Ricoh included a soft pouch for carrying the Theta V, but for the price it would have been nice if they could have also included a simple hardshell case with a soft inner material to protect the lenses. - I've already mentioned the fact that you can't buy extra batteries, but another thing worth mentioning is the battery life. I know I listed it as a pro because for me personally the battery lasted long enough, but like I said above, if you plan on using it professionally I expect that you will feel very limited by the life of the internal battery. - Poor connectivity - in my experience with the Theta V, the wifi range is extremely poor especially outdoors. My phone would drop the connection to the camera if I was moving around, and even when I was standing just a few feet away from the Theta it would still disconnect and none of the app features would work until I reconnected the wifi connection. Again, this is just another inconvenience that, when paired with the rest of them, makes for a frustrating user experience a lot of the time. If the wifi connection wasn't such garbage and you could start/stop recording from a number of feet away (like you should be able to) then it would be so much better. - As easy as the software is to use, it's still kind of a pain that you need special software to convert or play these videos. I understand that is just the nature of the beast of 360 videos, but it's still a con as far as I'm concerned. - Price. Obviously I have no idea what it costs to design or manufacture a device like this, but based on my use and experience with it, I would say that a price tag of around $300-400 would seem much more reasonable, especially given its limitations. In my opinion $500+ is a lot of money to spend on this item which is certainly neat but has some serious and restrictive shortcomings. - In my experience it is ideal to use mounted on a stationary tripod. Not only is the 360 video a bit hard to watch if the camera is also in motion, but the stitching from the software that removes the Theta from the frame becomes really noticeable and weird-looking when the pixels around it are moving. - Very poor dynamic range, especially in low light - I wouldn't expect the low-light performance of any $500 camera to be great, but even with that being said it is quite awful. The dynamic range is much better when there's lots of available light, but if you're shooting in an area that's even slightly dim you will lose almost all of the detail in any dark or shadowy part of the frame. - I would have liked the ability to rotate a recording within the app whether before or after filming. For example, so you could hold the Theta upside down in order to get an extremely low angle. Perhaps this is a feature and I just didn't see it, but I don't think it's possible and I think that a rotation option would make it a lot more versatile. - The total remaining recording time left on your internal memory is hidden in the live view settings - I'm listing this is a con because I think this information should absolutely be displayed on the main app/live view screen, not buried in a menu somewhere. When you're limited to 19GB of internal memory, it becomes extremely important to manage your space and I think that would be much easier if the remaining memory was always visible within the app, just like the battery meter. All in all, the Theta V is a really neat and interesting piece of equipment that does a relatively good job of recording 360 video and audio in a fairly simple way. However, it has some pretty significant limitations that make it impossible for me to be able to justify keeping it. I think that if Ricoh addresses some of these problems for the next version of the Theta, it could be a truly wonderful device that would absolutely have a spot in my camera bag. But for now it feels like something that is almost there but just not quite enough to be worth having at this point in time.","December 5, 2017",Chris P. Bacon
"Good dynamic range and companion apps, but disappointing build-quality",2.0,"As my 360 virtual tour business started taking off, I ""upgraded"" to this camera and though I really wanted to like it, I was very disappointed in the build-quality. The first unit I ordered had one of its lenses misaligned, making half the 360 image blurry, so I had to return it. But once I received the replacement unit and used it on the very first project, I found that it had the same exact problem as the first one. The attached photo, taken in good lighting conditions, illustrates the misalignment of one lens making the whole right-side of the spherical image blurry and as you can see the resolution is not that great either. The only reason I did not give a one-star rating is because of the good dynamic range and decent companion apps.","September 3, 2018",Kris Tarr
Not worth the price.,3.0,"I didn't expect the greatest but for $560 CAD, I expected more quality than what I'm getting. My 360 tours looked like I used a 2009 phone with 25 megapixels. The noise and chromatic abberation is pretty bad. However I need it for my job and the only affordable option for the platform I'm using. This is at most a $300-$400 camera.","May 15, 2020",VN
Not durable enough to absorb a 2 feet fall.,2.0,"Used this extensively in our European tour. It took very good 360 photos and videos. It fell flat on a cobbled stone road while on a slim tripod, the 2 lenses survived the impact but not the unit. It starts up for a few seconds then a beep and red light goes off then powers off. I am now sending to Ricoh service for a fix under warranty. Not a durable product and I am disappointed.","October 27, 2019",JP King
"Excellent, easy to use, but image quality - not the best",4.0,"Excellent for non-professional 3D photographers; Image is not as good as I expected.  Ricoh Theta Z1 is probably better to obtain higher image quality. However, it is Overpriced and it can be damaged easily (no protection anti-shock by design, so be extra-cateful!). Here it is my story: After using my new V camera less than 3 weeks, a powerful wind took it down with the tripod; I was lucky as the lens were not damaged. AND, again lucky to avoid a huge repair price provided by the service, and made it work again by myself (I have optoelectrinics background). So far, all works great, the only thing that bothers me is the image quality (obviously depends on the lens) I reccommend the device - it is a wonderful technological work in progress - well done and delightful!","September 21, 2020",Sanda Iordachescu

,,"Have been a big fan of Ricoh Theta cameras for some time and have a good experience with 360 media and equipment. Here are the Pro's of the V in my experience, compared with the S and other cams: - 4k video is really good quality and copes with low lighting well (far far better than the Nikon KeyMission). - 4k video can be streamed to youtube via a PC (a driver, currently in beta, is needed to do this but it does it well). - the transfer speeds over wifi are very fast (a big step up over the Theta S) - The app is still really great. - It can be charged with any charger (Theta S would refuse to charge with a high amp usb charger) - Ability to run apps on it seems promising (edit: This is being rolled out soon 2018) - Ability to sense tilt seems promising (edit: now auto stabilises video) - Small deadzone. the lenses are close together, there's very little dead space in the image. - images every 4 seconds with timelapse mode rather than 7 - can stream to a tv that has an amazon firestick. The Cons: - Same image sensor as the Theta S. The camera has a faster processor and you should get less noise on the images, but the resolution is the same. - Image stitching seems worse.. maybe due to the new lens system.. Imagine a firmware update will fix this. (edit: some way to being fixed) - Still no SD Card slot. Don't feel like opening this one up just yet, but all the others have had SD cards hidden inside them.. these have probably been kept hidden as they'd need a fast SD card to work well with 4k video.. perhaps people would complain their card didn't work all the time if they put an access slot in? insta, samsung, mija all have this. - Still has a plastic tripod thread, this was a bit fragile and actually broke on my S. - There's no autostabilistion like on Mija or insta360 cameras, despite it having sensors to do so.. this should at least be able to be applied in post production on the app. (Edit: the autostabilisation now works) - Bit pricey really.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2017",mark caswell-daniels
,,"Things you need to understand about this camera. 1. It takes 360° Spherical images. 2. It does not spin around 3. You need to use two apps. The Ricoh Theta App and the Ricoh Theta+ app. 4. You need to learn how to remove the Nadir. Check YouTube for tutorials on this.  The nadir is the image that remains of the tripod mount you use when you take a picture. 5. You need to learn about Tiny Planets.  These are app made filtered images that are pretty cool.  Again check Instagram this time for examples. 6. Learn how to take images using the self timer function. 7. You will also need a monopod with a tripod base suitable for this camera. The Ricoh one is overpriced.  I bought a carbon fibre one and a separate base. You don’t need one straight away - but as you develop your 360° photo taking skills it will be a requirement. Essentially this is the latest model of the Theta family.  (UPDATE MAY2019 THE Z1 IS NOW THE LATEST MODEL) It has a faster processor and offers 4K 360° video as well as spherical sound (with added microphone) (UPDATE- I USED THE EXTERNAL MICROPHONE AND IT ADDED NOTHING IMHO - OTHER THAN A WIND NOISE SUPPRESSING FOAM, THERE WAS NO BENEFICIAL INCREASE IN SOUND CLARITY) The theta has the best examples of stitched in camera stitching of all the cameras out there.  For the money you can’t really get  better.  So there’s one reason to get it. The camera uses its in house Wi-fi to connect to your smart phone and you take the photo using the theta app. You can extend the connection by connecting the camera to your home or any router - a feature only V can do. I would also advise getting a silicon skin straight away. Cheap enough to buy. (UPDATE - A SILICON SKIN CREATES A SHADOW IN THE IMAGE, SO BUY A CASE INSTEAD) There is a more technical side to manipulating and displaying 360° photos so you do need to do your research otherwise you will be disappointed. However if you’re set on joint the 360° revolution (pun intended) this is the best camera you can get for the money. Both the little sister and brothers of this camera the S and the SC are equally good at taking still photos - you just lack the 4K and a few other features.  So if you don’t want to spend £300+ I would advise getting one of those.  They’re a bit slower due to the processor but they are pretty brilliant too.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 28, 2018",Pete E

Even though Amazon's description says it can, or rather, doesn't actually state implicitly that you need the microphone to achieve 360 spacial audio recording. If you don't want the 360 spacial audio then it's a great camera by itself. Converting software is required to get it into an equirectangular format and download times from the camera to a laptop is quite slow, to a phone (I have an iPhone 7) is reeeeeeeeeally slow!

,,"This is an impressive, small, 4K 360 camera. It is very easy to use after a little bit of preparation linking the unit to your mobile phone. This involves downloading the Ricoh app available for iOS or Android, in my case installing a firmware update, and linking the phone and the camera via bluetooth. The camera takes 360 still frames, 360 video and will stream 360 video live. Without the optional, but very expensive, attachable microphone, it still captures sound at a fair quality level using in built microphones. There is a software update which links the camera directly to an Oculus Go headset so that you can review images immediately after capture in a VR environment which is a big bonus. Less positively the battery life of the camera is quite limited, you cannot add additional storage to the camera as there's not memory card port, and it's very easy to get out of bluetooth range in use so you can't press the shutter button remotely from a distance - so there's a danger you end up appearing in all shots. Overall though an easy to use quality camera. Four stars.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 24, 2019",Dr. Paul Ell
,,"Bought the Theta V for use as an underwater camera, along with the Ricoh TW-1 underwater housing. It seemed to get the best reviews for the price. Very easy to use with minimal buttons for operation - handy when you have thick scuba gloves on! Slightly annoying there is no memory card slot - I've found that it will record ~45 minutes of footage in 4k before it is full. Battery life seems good however. Also fairly time consuming to get the footage into a usable state to upload to YouTube etc but it's worth it. Stitch lines are there in underwater footage but far less noticeable than I saw with other cameras, Ricoh TW-1 underwater housing also has a visible crescent of the housing at the bottom of the shot but no way around this. As above, the combination of camera and housing was the best I felt I could get for the money. The camera is not as compact as other GoPro style cameras but feels sturdy with good built quality. Certainly not disappointed and will continue to enjoy using it!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 2, 2018",gillipies

However the stitching on them was never perfect, it was almost impossible to take them in busy places and they take quite a while to take with a Pixel XL. After reading a number of reviews and looking at the Pros and Cons of cameras which were slightly cheaper/more expensive. This one works for me for low light/normal UK weather mainly just taking photos with this. The main negative for me is that the lenses can't be replaced, so if you drop this camera and it's not insured you will have to buy a new one for £££.

,,"... ich habe mit der LG 360 CAM begonnen, bin dann zur RICOH Theta S gewechselt und nun bei der Theta V. Was die Software der Kamera  betrifft, ist noch sehr viel Luft nach oben. Die Verarbeitung ist hochwertig, die Optik gut, das Stitching bei Video und Photo wesentlich besser geworden, auch die Geschwindigkeit der Übertragung auf das Smartphone geht jetzt rasant. Die Klagen, welche hier geführt werden, sind verständlich aber durchaus nicht immer gerechtfertigt: z. B. mache ich fast immer Serienfotos mit der Intervallfunktion mit  ISO oder Belichtungs Vorwahl. Ich habe die Kamera auf einem sehr handlichen Selfie Stick in der Tasche und kann sie somit schnell bedienen. Nachbearbeitet werden Fotos und Videos auf meinem LG G5 mit diversen Apps von der Retouche bis hin zur Objektentfernung - nur bei Stativaufnahmen. Auch die nicht allein für die Theta V typischen chromatichen Aberrationen, welche gegenüber der Theta S weniger gravierend sind, werden nachbearbeitet. Erst dann erfolgt das Hochladen auf die ein oder andere Plattform. Insgesamt bin ich mit dieser Kamera sehr zufrieden. Softwareupdates und - Weiterentwicklung sind vom Hersteller in Aussicht gestellt. Klare Kaufempfehlung.","Reviewed in Germany on October 14, 2017",Casse pied
,,"Although the camera does what it says, and records at 4k, what I hadn't taken into account was that the 4k now has to spread over a 360 degree sphere.  This means that the final viewed quality is a lot less than HD.  Not the fault of teh camera, just a fact of life that there are not enough pixels to go around. Having said that - it is a super easy camera to use, stitching is in real time - no need for any post in that respect which is a huge bonus.  I used NCH VideoPad to edit together a couple of clips without any problem at all. Any people / objects more than about 2 meters away loose definition and as for someone at the other side of the room - forget about it.  This camera is for intimate settings like a small music session, or a group of people chatting. As for me, I'm now waiting for the 180 degree cameras due in 2019.  They have more raw pixels to shoot with and the final image only has to be spread across a hemispheres - by all accounts giving much sharper experience.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 25, 2018",Oliver
,,Easy to carry around in your pocket and works with the press of a button. Make sure that you get into the centre of what's happening because it's a 360 camera so you don't point it like a normal camera. Spatial audio is actually very good. Can film in very low light with great results.,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on October 10, 2019",Michael Crowe

,,"Bildqualität ist auf mäßigem Smartphonemamera-Niveau (letztere kann natürlich keine 360 Grad Fotos). Naja, es sollen ja keine Kunstwerke sein, die Kamera ist für Schnappschüsse gedacht. Enttäuscht bin ich von der Bluetooth-Funktion, in die ich größere Erwartungen gesteckt hätte. V.a. in Kombination mit der iPhone App, hier gäbe es viel Optimierungspotential. Die eigentlich sehr elegante Funktion, via Bluetooth-Verbindung die GPS Position zu übertragen, auch wenn die App gerade nicht geöffnet ist (damit man auch mal mit der Kamera direkt ein Foto machen kann, ohne jedes Mal das Handy einzuschalten und die App starten zu müssen) kann man im Alltag getrost vergessen, denn die App verbraucht dann unverschämt viel Strom (nach wenigen Stunden ist der Akku ganz leer, also ungeeignet für einen Urlaubstag mit gelegentlichen Schnappschüssen). Die Geotagging-Funktion der App ist von den Entwicklern offensichtlich nie im realen Einsatz getestet worden. Das Intervall in dem die GPS Position abgefragt wird ist wohl viel zu kurz programmiert, ohne Einflussmöglichkeit dies zu verlängern um den Stromverbrauch auf ein Maß zu reduzieren, damit die Funktion nutzbar ist. (Möchte man den Stromverbrauch der App vorrübergehend reduzieren, geht dass nur über die Einstellung in der App selbst, diese ist aber nur verfügbar wenn die Kamera über WLAN verbunden ist, nicht bei Verbindung nur über Bluetooth. Sehr umständlich, und der Weg die stromfressende vermutlich jede Sekunde erfolgende GPS Lokalisierung über die iPhone Einstellung zu deaktivieren, um vorübergehend den Akkuverbrauch des Smartphones zu reduzieren - ohne nur dafür extra die Kamera aus der Tasche zu holen, einzuschalten, WLAN zu aktivieren, dann in der App ins Untermenü zu gehen... - ist wegen der unsauber bzw. schlecht programmierten App auch zwecklos: Die App zieht auch massig Strom wenn man ihr den Zugriff auf die GPS Position entzieht - sie versucht es wohl sekündlich weiter auch wenn sie gar keinen Zugriff auf die GPS Position hat und verheizt den Akku nutzlos weiter). Die zweite eklatante Fehlplanung ist, dass man die Bluetooth Funktion nicht für einen Fernauslöser  nutzen kann. D.h. man hat nur folgende Möglichkeiten: 1. Auslösen an der Kamera -> Daumen/Hand ist immer gigantisch groß und störend im Bild 2. Auslösen über die Smartphone App -> jedes Mal extra Handy aus der Tasche holen, App starten, auf Verbindung warten, und auf jedem Foto hat man das Handy in der Hand (braucht somit auch immer beide Hände und hat keine mehr frei -> umständlich, und lästig da eine einhändige Benutzung unmöglich ist (mit kleinem Kind unterwegs, oder eine Tasche in der Hand ... unmöglich) 3. Eine überteuerte, schwer erhältliche kabelgebundene Fernbedienung von Ricoh -> kabelgebunden? geht’s noch? Wir schreiben das Jahr 2017, nicht 1917! Die Kamera benutzt auch keinen Film mehr... Ärgerlich, da alles an Hardware vorhanden und eingebaut ist, was man für wesentlich elegantere und praktischere Lösungen brauchte: 4. Einen kleinen billigen Bluetooth-Fernauslöser (am besten direkt integriert in einen Selfiestick, den sieht man am Foto nicht und man hat keine skurrile Riesen-Hand formatfüllend im Foto) direkt via Bluetooth mit der Kamera verbinden 5. Als Notlösung (aber immer noch viel besser als die aktuell möglichen Varianten 1-3) den Fernauslöser mit dem Handy verbinden, und die Theta App würde diesen als Auslöser akzeptieren wie nahezu jede Kamera App. Dann könnte das Handy in der Tasche bleiben, und man bräuchte nur eine Hand (BT-Auslöser am Griff des Selfie-Stick) 6. Über die Mikrofon-Buchse auslösen (mit entsprechenden massenhaft verfügbaren Selfiesticks, die über statt mit Bluetooth über die Kopfhörerbuchse des Smartphones verbunden werden (praktisch, da kein Akku/Batterie leer werden kann, aber kleines Kabel im Bild) Eigentlich könnten alle Kritikpunkte mit einem kleinen Update der App bzw. der Kamerafirmware behoben werden, dann gäbe es 4 Sterne (1 Abzug wegen der Bildqualität). Ich bezweifle aber, dass Ricoh das machen wird...","Reviewed in Germany on October 7, 2017",reinhold messner

,,"Ich besitze bereits die Theta S und habe heute die Theta V getestet. Aufnahme mit niedrigster ISO Stufe vom Stativ bei schattigem Wetter indoor. Bei meinem Test habe ich (unfairerweise) das Sigma 15mm Fisheye, die Theta S und die Theta V gegenübergestellt (siehe Bildanhang). Das Ergebnis: Natürlich können die Thetas bei der Bildqualität nicht mal annähernd mit dem Fisheye Objektiv mithalten. Interessanter für mich ist jedoch, dass sich die Bildqualität der Theta V nicht wirklich von der der Theta S unterscheidet. Die Bilder der V wirken imho etwas natürlich in der Farbgebung, bieten aber bei Schärfe, Rauschen, etc. keine Verbesserung gegenüber der S. Bei anderen Testschüssen hätte ich der S sogar eine etwas schärfere Darstellung attestiert. Gibt hier sicher auch kleine Schwankungen innerhalb der Modellreihe. Nüchtern betrachtet logisch. Selbes Objektiv bei selber Auflösung -> hier wurde also wahrscheinlich nur etwas an der internen Bildbearbeitung gefeilt. Videoqualität ist für mich uninteressant, da ich die Theta nur für das Erstellen kleiner virtueller Touren im Web brauche. Dafür eignet sich die Kamera ganz gut, da das aufwändige Fotografieren mit Nodalpunktadapter mit anschließendem Stitching entfällt. Für's Web ist die Qualität grundsätzlich auch ganz OK, wenn man Abstriche in Kauf nimmt. Fazit: Gutes, einfach bedienbares Gerät zum schnellen Panorama-Erstellen. Ein Update von der Theta S lohnt sich für Fotografen aber definitiv nicht.","Reviewed in Germany on February 28, 2018",Klaus Zettler

,,"L'ho comprata in offerta e usata per qualche settimana, già dai primi attimi impugnandola ho notato che il prodotto è molto solido e ben fatto, ma non è tutto oro ciò che luccica! Di fatti prossimamente vedrete i contro che sono per me molto più dei pro. Uso dell'App: Appena configurato la camera con il mio Smartphone ho subito notato che si bloccava e dava non pochi problemi di trasmissione dati, ho prontamente aggiornato la camera ma nulla è cambiato. Lasciando un uso quasi fastidioso dell'applicazione essendo molto instabile. Qualità Foto/Video: Onestamente dai video visti online tutti ne parlavano bene, io da smartphone vedevo che non era nulla di c'è ma immaginando fosse solo una bassa qualità dell'anteprima ho fatto vari test, poi scaricando le immagini e i video nel pc ho visto che era anche peggio. Paragonabili a Smartphone di 5o6anni fa... Grande delusione. Archiviazione: la fotocamera ha solo un archivio interno non espandibile di circa 19gb, che permettono circa 2h di video in fullhd e migliaia di fotografie, unica pecca praticamente è molto complesso gestire il file 360, pur essendo un professionista del settore i file hanno un codec che complica ogni cosa anche con pc molto prestanti. Durata: questo come la limitazione dell'archiviazione è l'ennesimo tasto dolente, la batteria non si può cambiare essendo integrata, e ha la durata media di circa 40/50min a secondo degli usi. Inoltre la fotocamera non può essere ricaricata durante il suo stesso utilizzo, sarebbe stati utilissimo poterlo fare attraverso un powerbank. Pro? è molto rubusta ed è fornito di un pratico astuccio protettivo. (a mio dispiacere non trovo altro) Conclusioni: non vi consiglio di prenderla almeno che non siete amatori e non avete particolari esigenze di alta qualità, io l'avevo presa per sfruttarla a lavoro e per viaggi, l'ho prontamente restituita e prossimamente prenderò la Insta360 One X, costa 100€ in più ma ha batterie intercambiabili e alloggiamento per microsd.","Reviewed in Italy on March 20, 2019",Federico Z.

Meh,1.0,"Polarized Black Chrome finish (non Elite series) Cons: - fit in frames is too tight. Much, much harder to install/remove than stock lenses - very thin compared to stock lenses - lenses are not truly black (slight green tint) - cloudy, muddy image - terrible contrast - ""black chrome"" finish isn't even remotely close to the ""black iridium"" they are trying to copy from Oakley lenses. Eyes totally visible through the lenses. Pros: - customer service is great - polarized Conclusion: At the end of the day, either spend double the money on the official Oakley replacement lenses, or spend $15-20 on some other brand because these are awful for the money. I have only tested the regular (non-Elite series) lenses. The Elite's may be free from issues but at that price, I would rather just buy the OEM ones.","October 12, 2017",MJ
Great but not perfect,4.0,"Bought these lenses after my original polarized lenses got all scratched up from years of use.  I compared them directly with a friend's new pair of Oakley's and although these are really good, they don't compare.  The originals seem to have better contrast as well as overall less light transmission, with my eyes feeling more relaxed but with a clearer image if that makes any sense.  At this price point, however, I would wholly recommend these, just know that they're not going to be a perfect replacement for the originals.","May 9, 2017",Steven Wong
Strange mirroring on the inside of the lens,3.0,"Nice lenses, very clear, but the lens that I ordered was a very light brown which is ok, especially for not super bright days. But the inside of the lens has some sort of strange blue mirroring.. seems like it shouldn't be there because on bright days you get a strange blue dot in your vision unless the sunglasses are so tight on your face that no light comes in the side of the glasses. Its pretty obnoxious. Not sure I'd order again","December 29, 2019",Julian Shea
Not up to par,2.0,"Bought a pair to replace original Oakley lenses, the ones that arrived were distorted. Revant customer serviced provided with a second set of lenses, however they also arrived with the same distortion issue. Think of when you change prescription on eyeglasses and your eyes are trying to adjust, that's what they felt like however my eyes never did adjust.

,,"After reading a number of less than sterling reviews, I wasn't expecting a lot from these lenses, but the original lenses in my Oakley Fives Squareds had seen better days, having provided nearly a decade's use. However, having dropped them a few times, the lenses were a little scratched. I didn't want to throw the sunglasses away and replacement original lenses were about the same price as a new pair of (discounted) sunglasses, so I thought I'd give these Revants a try. I bought the polarising Titanium mirror shield, replacing non-polarising smoke grey lenses. The replacements are a perfect fit (which is the least you should expect given the quality of modern tooling), but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the lenses. They certainly feel light - subjectively lighter than the originals, but that's not to say they feel cheap. The lenses provide at least as much shade as the originals, but are also clearer (potentially due to the build up large and micro-scratches on the older lenses) and have much better contrast than the original (non-polarised) lenses. I was a bit skeptical based on some reviews here, which is why I felt I should leave this review. I couldn't be happier - I hope to get another decade out of my Oakleys and would happily recommend these replacement lenses.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 15, 2018",PeeBee
,,"A little disappointing, but I guess you get what you pay for. These are not anything like the quality of genuine Oakley lenses, but they're a fraction of the price. They're good enough for most situations and fit perfectly. But where I find they let me down is coping with e.g. low sun glare on wet roads where they can cause a sort of ""grey out"" effect. My scratched old Oakley lenses dealt with anything and even sharp sunlight didn't distort the overall  clarity, but these are definitely not as good. But if you want cheap replacement lenses for your Oakley frames which are for occasional use then these are fine.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on October 11, 2015",Dougal22

Missing a few parts but still a good little kit,4.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Good kit, very straightforward & don't really need instructions (all the parts & values are printed on the boards) and came together quickly.  That said it was missing a couple of parts (one 2.2K resistor and the variable 104 resistor), fortunately I have a well stocked tickle trunk so could still fully assemble. A couple of assembly modifications you may want to consider: -I added a two position terminal block (item inside the white circle in the last picture), it makes it easier/quicker to add the power source when in use.  They're very inexpensive and I add them to all my projects. -I install the 4x8 pin connectors last.  Will install/solder the female connectors first, place the male connectors into the female and THEN dry fit the other board.  Once the two boards are aligned and square then solder the male connectors in place.","April 7, 2019",Ron Swanson
Not for beginners,3.0,"Bought this as a beginner project kit, I'd never soldered before and didn't really have any past experience or knowledge. The instructions are useless besides trying to squint and follow pictures. The kit doesn't include a battery pack or wires to actually turn on your creation once you're done. I spent 5 hours putting this thing together, I ended up doing a ton of reading online while building this thing because nothing is explained to you in the kit. All in all it was satisfying to turn on my creation after pulling apart an old clipper set to steal it's wiring and battery pack, but it was a very stressful introduction to soldering. For beginners, a project like this would be great, if it had detailed instructions, and for experienced solderers, this is a very basic and pointless project. I'd recommend spending a little bit more money for a better kit. A radio project kit I ordered came in today with full instructions and a booklet that explains the who, what, when, where & why's of soldering. That would have been much better to start with.","August 28, 2020",SolomonDort
Buy This One,5.0,"This is the best practice board that I have found by far. Everything came that should have, everything worked. There are tons of solder points here, it has got the most practice for your buck.

good solder practice but not impressed.,3.0,It was a fun project to assemble after not soldering for quite awhile. My main complaint is the packaging.

,,"Bought a dozen for an electronics club (10-12 years old). Assembly has a few gotchas with orientation of the parts but if you read (look carefully at) the supplied printed instructions (I failed to do that) you should do fine. Definite pros: printed instruction; really cute and daft; cheap! Cons: Power supply not supplied.  We used some USB break-out boards and a couple of short pieces of solid core insulated wire.  If you don't have the USB break-out, you might just cut the end of an unused or broken (device-end) USB cable, find the 0V and 5V wires and solder them in place. Really a lot of fun. Club members had very few problems that weren't the good kind.","Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2019",claude andrew
,,"First and foremost- This kit assembled didn't work for me, but it's entirely my fault.  I rushed through this kit, and I installed the IC's on the incorrect side of the corresponding PCB- so I effectively put the IC's in backwards.  Again, my fault entirely, both PCBs have pretty clear silk screen patterns- which is a bit surprising to me considering how heavily populated they get. So while I can't comment on how this kit functions as a completed unit, I did enjoy putting it together and although the instructions I got were hazy (hazy broken English and hazy from faded printer toner) I never got confused while assembling this. You might be thinking ""Never got confused?  You put the ICs in backwards!"".  Again, I was in a rush.  I was reminded of some Christmas gift business, and rather than simply stop working on this kit and resume at a less busy time, I rushed through it and in my hurry I just threw the ICs on, noting their orientation but not paying attention to the side of the PCB I soldered them to.  A lesson learned that in addition to driving, you should never build electronic devices while distracted I suppose! And touching back on the PCBs, again, they're marked with a easy to read silk screen, and the kit either had just the right amount, or a bit more of the parts needed to make this hourglass.  I have numerous other soldering kits to work on at this time (when I'm not distracted, of course!) but I may buy this again one day and assemble it correctly.","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2019",Hawk eye

Not very organised in the way they are written. Its a fun kit though in the way that you get to do alot of solder points. I noticed something was wrong with the performance of mine even though i followed the directions to a T, so i looked at the pictures of peoples in the reviews and noticed another guy that did one side of the solder resistors in a different directions than the instructions and his worked perfectly which just further confused me even more. Good practice though i guess...","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020",J B

Nothing really show where components go but a photo (most kits will have a drawing of the board with component numbers and part description next to it. This one did not even show how the LED's go in, a first timer might have thought they were non polar and just stuck them all in random ways. Also note it takes 5V but does not include anything (no cable, socket....) you are on your own to have a wire to hook up and find a 5V supply.

I connected a 2xCR2032 holder to mine to deliver the required power. You could also add a AA or AAA battery holder or just add leads to connect to a bench supply. I broke the adjustable trim pot on mine, make sure to note the limits of the adjustment (<1 full turn) that adjusts the speed of the hourglass so you don't make the same mistake.

"It does what I wanted it to do, but installation was a little frustrating",3.0,"Just like everyone planning to buy this, I have a flat screen tv to mount on the wall, and wanted a way to run wired behind the wall. In my case, I have a fireplace below the tv, so it wasn't as straight forward as running up and down the wall. And it was on an exterior wall, so I had insulation to deal with. General set up was fine, but ran into an issue with the electrical hookup. Which in my opinion is the most important part! See attached photos. The instructions show push in connectors. The outlets supplied do not have this type of connection. I was able to figure it out, but it left me uneasy since the whole point of this system was the electrical component. Then, because of this, I connected the wires to the outlet, before threading it into the box (back cover). Problem: once the cable is pushed into the back of the outlet, you cannot take them out! Literally says once time use only. So I had to remove the wiring from the wall, thread it into the box from the other side, and re-fish the wire through my wall. I got it done in the end, but had to double check everything several times to feel like I got it right. Everything's done now. And looks decent. Unfortunately, some of my hdmi cables are not long enough to cover the extra distance through the wall, so I'll be ordering longer ones. I bought this at $71.82. It's a little pricey for what it is. And I would have expected a smoother experience. But in the end, things worked out.","February 7, 2018",Kevin
Good all in one solution,4.0,"This is a good solution for running both low voltage (audio and video signals) as well as AC current. Running an AC power cord through a wall from a TV without something like this would be very dangerous as those cords are not rated for being inside a wall. I found installation fairly straight forward but I've got a fair bit of experience. While as their advertising points out you don't need to be an electrician,  you will be responsible for making  AC line voltage connections that if done incorrectly could cause a fire, injure or even kill.  Read and follow the manufacturers directions and you should be fine.  Here are some installation tips that might make it easier. 1. This unit would be best used on an inside wall.  Use on an outside wall especially in a cold climates, will break the vapour barrier which could lead to condensation moisture in the wall. 2. It is very important that you don't cut the openings too close to a wall stud as the cams on the box and the cover-plate need to be able to move to be secured to your wall. 3. Try using small pieces of painters tape to hold the pattern to the wall then trace around with a pencil. 4. Lightly scoring the outline with a sharp razor knife before using the drywall saw can minimize tearing and breaking. 5.  Make sure you are mounting the bottom box low enough where it will be fully concealed by your furniture.  When I did mine I wish I had dropped it a couple of inches and I also forgot to take into account a cross bar that is right in the centre of my component stand meaning my furniture is farther away from the wall than I'd like. 6. Once you are done, you defiantly deserve a beverage of your choosing and some unrestricted binge watching of your favourite show!","July 8, 2020",Stakman1
Great Product with one installation issue,4.0,"The product does a great job of hiding cables to a TV including providing a power outlet at a higher level.  However, most TV's these days have a transformer between the outlet and the TV rather than the old fashioned direct 110V cable supply.  In my case I used electrical tape to attach the transformer and cable excess to the wall mounting device, something that can't be done with all. Installation issue concerns screwing into the plastic tabs that affix the switchbox to the drywall,  The crews should be worked into the plastic tab BEFORE trying to install or you will never manage to do it.  I used Jigaloo to ease the cutting of the thread into the tab and made sure the screws were easy to tighten.  After that all was smooth.","April 29, 2019",Aramis
Works great,4.0,"I think this is a great kit, but I wished the outlet power cord was a couple of feet longer. Nonetheless it is useful if you're hanging your TV and hiding audio cables. I like the product, but knocked off 1 star just because the power cable/wires were not long enough and I had to go out and purchase a longer cable myself.  The power cable in the kit works great if you're power outlet is just below the tv, but if you're hanging above a fireplace as I had to, the cable has to route sideways and then down and the power cable was shy of about 2ft for my set up.","February 11, 2018",Michael Raymur
"Very easy and fast installation, end result looks professional!",5.0,"I was first-time installing a TV on the wall by myself and went for this model over other less expensive variants because of the claimed simplified installation process. As advertised, the hardest part was to find perfect spot for the installation and avoid the studs, but once we were through that, setting up the plugs themselves took literally around 5 minutes! As a bonus, the finished setup looks very professional, and the wall plates match well the other outlets in the vicinity. Will recommend this to all my friends!","December 4, 2017",Kostu-san
"Nice kit, easy to install, works well.",5.0,"Nice little kit, easy to install, electrical is hard wired but really easy to work with and all wires labelled so if you aren't familiar with electrical it's really hard to mess it up. Cut 2 holes in drywall, hook up electrical connection between the two, pass your other wires and then screw the plates on (built with retaining clips that move into place behind the drywall as you tighten). It was really simple and easy to install. Bonus is you can plug the electrical into a surge protector so whatever you plug into the outlet will be protected.","May 8, 2020",Helphin
Great product then some bad luck.,3.0,"This kit was fairly easy to install and its design was functional. The wire provided was sufficient in length and it is stamped with CSA approval. The missign two stars are for the missing wire connector caps from one of the kits I ordered. The same kit’s faceplate was scuffed and clearly a returned product. Its packaging tape seal was also opened. I did not want to wait for an exchange. Pros: Great product, material strength, instructions, and design. Cons:  Poor quality control; I took unexpected time to the hardware store to buy some wire connector caps.","December 13, 2017",MLW
"Good Product, Easy to Install",5.0,"Installation Tips: !With Power Off! 1. Work Top Down 2. Cut holes 3. Run wires (through both wall and plastic pieces < both the boxes and their white inserts) 4. Connect wires - to connectors 5. Fix top box (the electrical and white one) into wall < make sure the connectors for your TV/Monitor are easy to get at. 6. Connect your TV/Monitor (including tv plug) and mount it to wall < I assume you have a bracket already there 7. Push (or pull from below gently) any excess cable into the wall behind your TV. 8. Mount / connect (NOT THE POWER CORD!) the bottom box - leave excess cable sticking out (i.e.) HDMI/Coax) alone. 9. Connect HDMI etc, to devices, move furniture back and push any excess cable back into the wall at the bottom end. 10.

Works great!,5.0,"Really enjoyed installing this.  The fit was simple enough and the plug on the bottom was a real time saver.  I've cut open walls in previous homes before to run wires for wall mounted TV's but this was even easier!  Such a cool product and well designed -- though I did use my own, larger gauge, higher quality wire to use behind the wall.  Now all my wires are hidden and it only took a few minutes to install (after cutting the holes).","November 23, 2018",Tyson Hein
"Hide those ugly cables now, this is an easy DYI project that takes an hour!",5.0,"Cables were an eye sore that I finally decided to get rid of. I initially made the mistake of purchasing the other kit that doesn't have electrical. Hiding electrically cables is a bad idea as it could cause a fire behind the walls, also your insurer probably would have an issue with it. Then I purchased this kit. Easy to use and the template is spot on. The dry wall cutting could be done with a simple knife, but I used the drywall cutter and it made my life very easy. The electrical bit was great as they colour code everything. Pros: - Sleek and appeal visual design - Install was simple - Electrical setup for dummies Cons: - Minor if any, larger than expected","July 20, 2020",Marty C
This cable organizer is great,5.0,"This organizer has two compartments, one for the electric cable and one for the rest of your cables. This is great because it is up to standard. It comes with a power cord that runs inside your wall. The quality is very high. The installation is not that easy (you need some tools to do the job).

Had to customize some pieces,4.0,"The install took me about 2 hours and a half. The result is really nice BUT it came after many sweats... The main problem is with the electrical junction box (and my walls). The gray plastic box where you attach the electrical wires together is too deep in my opinion. In fact, it is something like 1,5 times the depth of a regular electrical connection box. In my case, on my 1962 house on a wall that has fiberboard as insulation or vapor barrier behind the gypsum (garage on the other side), I had to be creative. In fact, I had to cut half of the depth of the connection box to make it fit because I didn’t want to make a hole in the board. I also had to cut a bit of the plastic part where you put the HDMI cables because it was also too deep. This product would be perfect for a clean new installation in a new house or one that is heavily renovated... With an existing house of a couple of years, there might be surprises such as the ones I encountered. On a more positive note, this product also fits on thick walls. Mine was about 3/4 of an inch thick and it worked. I easily made 3 HDMI cables and an audio cable pass through without any problem.","July 17, 2020",Daniel

Well designed.,4.0,"The product is excellent.  Well designed and achieves exactly what it was made to do. My only negative is that all the videos show it being installed on an interior wall, my situation was on an exterior wall so there was insulation and vapor barrier behind the drywall. Called the company 2 times to ask if this product could be used in this application but never received a call back. In the end I went ahead being very careful to not cut the vapor barrier. Had to push very hard to get the product into the opening due to the insulation. In the end I was able to but it was a bit of a struggle. A slightly less deep product for exterior walls would be ideal.","March 21, 2019",D Bell
Great kit!,5.0,"LOVE THIS KIT. It's pretty close to perfect, but installing it in a wall with insulation behind it can be a PITA.  Make sure you get some oversized vapour barrier housings, like these: https://www.amazon.ca/Globe-Electric-90118-Vapor-Barrier/dp/B00EAR9KNC But then you can't cut an oversized hole in the wall, as the wall plates use the cutout for stability, so you've gotta do some clever work by squeezing it all through the hole, and taping the vapour barrier box in with small pieces of vapour barrier tape. It would be nice if they made the holes in the back of the kit larger, as I can barely manage to get the cables all through.  I got (3) HDMI's, an optical cable, and an ethernet cable through mine.","October 25, 2016",krishan

Did the trick, exactly what I was looking for now I can sleep at night knowing I don't have a ""live power cord"" run directly through my drywall so now we are to code. Keep in mind if you have a fireblock in your wall you may have to cut a hole in your drywall about half way down to jump through it (there are youtube videos out there of people doing this, cut drywall, drill through the fireblock, run the cord through, fill with fire-resistant sealant, patch wall back up).

Works Great - a little pricey,4.0,Fairly easy to install if you do not mind cutting into your dry wall.

Good Solution for TV Installation,5.0,"This item gives you a very easy way to run cables inside the wall, leaving a clean wall instead of a mess of visible cables.  Make sure to check the wall for cross-braces in the stud bay though.  Fortunately I could remove the cross brace I ran into when installing this in the basement family room from the furnace room side of the wall.","September 24, 2019",Kevin in Petawawa

A must for hiding Tv and accessories cables,5.0,Installed this kit in about half hour. Tested it before I mounted it up and worked perfectly. Highly recommend this kit !!!,"July 19, 2020",RON SCOTT
Great Kit,5.0,"It comes with everything you need. I used for 1 HDMI and 1 Ethernet cable, but probably could fit another two or three cables. It would be better if the female end of the extension cord was a 90 degree angle instead of straight, so it would not stick out so far from the wall.","January 22, 2020",LTP

Great product to keep the kids busy,4.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Overall, the product is great.  But it doesn’t come with a clear instruction on how to turn it on.  The color is not very vibrant but still a good writing pad. It can be erased easily.  The pen should come with a string though so it doesn’t get lost easily.","August 25, 2019",mhin
Fun to use and really practical and ecofriendly,5.0,"I've always been on the lookout for eco-friendly products, and one of the most ""wasted"" things in my home is paper, whether for making to do lists,  and especially making drawings with a 4 year old kid. He practically draws only a few lines in a blank paper and wants to use another one and though I know he enjoys that, it makes me sad to waste all those paper. And here's an excellent solution, an LCD writing tablet! Ever since we received this item, my kid is obsessed with this, doodle then erase, and repeats the cycle several times in a day! I might need to buy another one for myself to use. Lol.. I love that we can ""write in color"", and the tablet itself is big and we can write or draw a lot.. I'll probably buy a smaller one for my kid and use this for myself and stick it to the fridge for my reminders. The writing is practically crisp and clear, and the lock-in mode is also great. I use that lock mode to encourage my kid to use all the spot before erasing the doodle. This is a great product, and I can this being used all the time and will last for years. Definitely recommended!","August 29, 2019",Maya.lg
Great for kids/easy to use,4.0,"This is a great product. I bought it to start writing with my kids. It is useful because they likes to draw. Also, they can makes sketches without using paper. They are entertained without the need to use an electronic device all day.  Echo friendly, no need to waste papers.  Our little one practices printing on it.  It does have a button on the bottom to switch off so you can't erase the screen. If you switch it the other way, you can press the button to easily erase the screen. Great for in the car and on the go to keep the kids busy.","November 26, 2019",Lucasmom
"Lots of giggles, no writing on the wall",5.0,"Saw this on a flash deal for $13, decided why not and picked it up for my 2yr old. He instantly loves drawing on it (and demanding we also draw on it) At first I was worried as he kept pressing the clear button a lot but he soon realised that it removes what he's drawing and now only presses it when needed saving the battery life. This drawing tablet is always on but acts like e-ink and only requires electricity when the clear button is pressed, this means it will still be good for power no matter how often he presses that button. Even then the battery is easily replaceable. The screen isn't too scratch resistant so when the little guy was playing outside on it and it got some dirt on it, it then scuffed a little bit but nothing noticeable. The colours are set, so if you draw in one spot it will come out green, another blue etc etc so if your child asks for a certain colour you won't be able to get it unless you choose the specific area of the screen where that colour is. All in all my child loves this, he can throw it around with no worry and then demand I pick it up and ""cuh-wer""","August 11, 2020",Dan
Very smooth to write on.,5.0,"Normally, I will talk in my videos but today my throat hurts, so if you watched the video but are still wondering what I think here goes. The LCD panel is really smooth to write on, Like the stylus just glides over it. Very very satisfying. There is a lock button which you can use to prevent the LCD from being erased, and was fun for me, as although, i played with this quite a bit, i am giving it to one of my sons for Christmas. With the lock button I was able to leave him a message he will see when he opens the LCD. Overall, this just made me smile. It didn't cost much, and was really nice to use.","December 4, 2019",WanderingFather
Nephew loves this!,5.0,"They are about to turn 2 and right now cognitive development is key, so we're getting them to use puzzles, play with soccer balls, really anything to get them using their extremities and the hope is that we have the next Picasso so our entire family can get on that generational retirement plan. That, or an NHL player. Either way, excellent tablet, they love the colors and using it.","March 20, 2020",MIKACHU
My kid did not like it and he loves to draw,1.0,"It is not bright enough to keep the kids entertained. my son loves to draw (plain draws, imagination) on my husband's phone with the creyon. but this tablet, hiiimmm he was not interested and he told me it's so faded he wants to really see what he's drawing so he put it away and never touch it again(he's3) and i had to return it. He is not an electronic zombie tough, he does not watch tv or use ipads, the only thing , he loves to draw on his father's phone. I guess you can give it a try just be aware it's not bright at all as it shows on the pictures.","October 8, 2020",Claudia Petre
Ideal Writing pad for school age child,5.0,"I bought this writing pad for my son who loves to draw and sketch things. Using paper makes his room untidy and to resolve that problem I bought this writing pad. This writing pad comes with a stylus and 2 batteries that would help to use this in out of the box status. It has to erase ability with one button and works perfectly to remove this that written over it. It takes very less battery power and after 2 weeks of work still, battery is working fine. My son loves this wriring pad.","July 5, 2020",K.G
"Useful for any age group, good quality",5.0,"This arrived quickly, and this has been great addition for work where I scribble down what I need to do for the day without wasting paper.  It has a holder for the “pen” which is great, and touch if a button to erase. Thinking of ordering a 2nd one for the kitchen to prep out meal plans for the week, or when I’m making sourdough to perform 6 sets of folds, good to have this to check it off.  Great for when my nephews come over to play tic tac toe, Pictionary etc...","September 5, 2020",Candace
Best of its kind,5.0,"I have bought 2 writing tablets before, both were ok at the beginning but later it gets broken and scratched. This one is 12 inches and its is pretty soft on the pen touches, and it feels great when writing on it. It comes with some colors so it is not just black and white. I like this tablet. Highly Recommend.","September 5, 2019",H.C.
My Daughter and I loves it!,5.0,"I bought a small one for my daughter a few weeks ago.  Love how it actually helps us save paper at home.  So I had to buy one for myself but had to be a bigger one.  And I got this!  Which is perfect size for me.  I use this to write down my to do list for the day, and other daily reminders.  I keep it displayed in the kitchen where I spend most of my day.  Awesome tool!","June 26, 2020",Twyx
Great for notes and children,5.0,"It is so light totake it everywhere and easy to use. Previously I used sticky notes, small dry erase boards, and I even covered my desktop with dry erase paper. But, sticky notes were everywhere, the dry erase boards were messy for daily notes or better used for drawing out thoughts. The best part is just pressing the trash button and it vanishes.","December 5, 2019",Misha
"Great idea, kind of flimsy",3.0,"My kid loves playing this and having me draw pictures for him. My one complaint is that it is actually quite flimsy. I am afraid that if I ever accidentally stepped on it as I am walking around a room with inadequate light that it will be a goner. It works perfectly and has brought hours of enjoyment to me and my child. I just wish that it didn't feel as flimsy. But I don't know, maybe a person could have a barn dance on it and it would survive.","October 23, 2020",Brett
Really simple to use and tons of fun!,5.0,"This little tablet is SO COOL! I thought I would have to plug it in or put batteries in it to make it work, but it doesn't need any of that and works right out of the box. I'm always looking for cool new activities since my nephew and my niece visit me pretty often and I know this will be a winner.","August 23, 2019",Amelie R.
especially good for small kids,4.0,"Fantastic for scribbling, writing notes, it has a switch, you can use, so you don't accidentally erase your scribbles, if you want to keep them for a while. The lines you draw on this are pretty fat though, (like using a 6b pencil), so it's difficult to draw small details or write with small letters. I use this to practice writing chinese letters and my kids use it for scribbling and practicing writing words. It comes with a spare battery, too :)","January 1, 2020",K
Wonderful,5.0,"This thing works great! I love the button erase function, so handy! Honestly brings me back to child hood. This was actually a gift, but of course I had to sneak into the package and try it out first. Writes great, the rainbow color is neat and the instant erase is wicked. Even has a button to stop you from accidentally erasing.","August 25, 2020",Jake B
nice toy for little kids!,5.0,"i was plan use it as a board to write something to help my memory, but when i open the box and my two years old son just standing beside me, then i found my son like it, he just learn how to use erase button in second, i have to say ,this is very great one can save my thousands of paper and my living room wall since my son know how to use pen......","May 27, 2020",yadong sun
Came with an extra battery,1.0,"This tablet came with an extra battery.  Wouldn't you assume that you had to put it in.  Took 2 adults, the world's tiniest screwdriver and 40 minutes to open the battery tab only to find out it already had a battery!!  Expected the colour to be brighter.  It is for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter to work on her letter recognition but she has not tried it yet.  Very disappointed.  Don't  waster your money!","May 9, 2020",Marianne Greenberg
Saves paper,5.0,"My kids loved it. Easy to use and there no edgy points from the product, its perfectly safe for kids. We bought this so they can save paper from doodling and it worked. Its an eco friendly i guess instead of buying lots of sketch papers for kids and its easy to clean too.","May 8, 2020",Barney
Good purchase.,5.0,My 1 year old can use it.  My 5 and 3 year old nephews were fighting over it on a recent visit.  The 3 year old dropped it numerous times and it held up just fine. Good purchase.,"September 10, 2019",Chilly
User friendly!!  Kid learn it fast!!,5.0,"The writing tablet is very easy to use. There is only one button, same button for on and off. The LCD has multiple colors which creates better drawings. It is suitable for ages 2 to 80. The pen that comes with the tablet is very smooth to write on the tablet. You can also use other stylus pens. I used it to teach kids with homework or take quick notes for work. Tablet is easily carried in a handbag as it is very slim. Great product and recommend.","July 23, 2020",David
Fun for kids and adults,5.0,"I was really surprise to see the well build of this product, it was strong and easy to use.

Perfect gift for kids stuck indoors,5.0,"Got this for my niece as she's stuck indoors all day. She loves to draw and is quite young so I dropped this off at their door.

Good product,5.0,"I bought this for my kid. It is a very good decision.  This little tablet was a lot of fun to play with the kids. Very easy to operate, just one button to erase the screen.

This writing tablet is excellent.,5.0,"My daughter is very like drawing, problem is wasted a lot of paper every day, that why I bought this,  is great, there are three colors, for a two year old child is also very simple to use.

Great buy,4.0,"Got this on deal of the day! Great buy! Kid loves it. I do wish it had a string for the pen. We added a string ourselves so she wouldn't lose it. It is all by pressure, so if lost you could figure something else out instead.","August 10, 2020",Jstone44

Great Product,4.0,"Nice product, my kids love it. But screen in too sensitive while writing we obviously rest the hand on the screen while holding the pen. That rested hand causes unnecessary marks (erased when we erase the entire screen) But overall great product.","November 9, 2019",Vishal
Your kids will spend hours exploring their creativity with this one!,5.0,"My 2.5 year old is obsessed with his drawing board! We take it everywhere. In the car, to the library, when we’re visiting family. He spends so much time drawing and then quickly erasing his masterpiece only to draw something new again.

nice for kids,5.0,"No longer will you have to find random pieces of paper for your kids to write on, and random pens, too. Save some trees and your sanity.

Great value for your money!,4.0,"I bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas and she loves it. The only criticism I have is that the screen can be dark.

Cleaning made simple and fun.,5.0,"Very convenient and useful, I keep one in my car now for easily cleaning. The gel itself is forgiving on most surfaces and will pickup everything it touches without leaving residue. I use it on my car and PC, it's even replaced my air duster. The gel is also very mesmerizing to use. My only gripe is that it can't be washed out, but there's very little anyone can do about that considering the nature of the product.","June 15, 2020",Rick
Very helpful customer service - Ridiculously fun,5.0,"Has a light fresh scent to it which I think is wonderful especially when cleaning out your car. My first order had a punctured seal, but they had a brand new one sent to me by next day (free of charge). 10/10 customer service! As for the cleaning, I find it ridiculously entertaining to roll slime over everything I own - my desk has never been so clear of dust","June 20, 2020",Marusech
GONNA BUY AGAIN!!!,5.0,"I LOVE IT!! For someone who's a clean freak (me), I am so happy to have this. It makes it so easy to clean the hard to reach spots in my car. I've been using small portions of it until it turns greenish so it's really worth it!","June 4, 2020",Jessamine
Dont leave it out in the sun or on the dash.,5.0,"Great product but DO NOT LEAVE IT IN THE SUN. Works great and as advertised.

Long as you dont do that, you're fine. It's the only thing that gets the cracks around the cupholders that vacuums can't get.","July 28, 2020",M J.
Left a gooey mess. Hard to clean the goop off.,1.0,The cleaning gel was way too soft and gooey. When I pulled it out of the container it basically was like runny goo. I had a hard time removing it from my hand. Tiny strands of the goo would come off and stick everywhere. The gooey gel was basically unusable. I think it had degraded.... I had to throw it away as it would’ve left bits and pieces of goop everywhere. What a mess. Don’t waste your money people.,"August 23, 2020",Amazon Customer
So satisfied,5.0,Very fun to use. Just vacuum first excess debris and then use this for final cleaning.,"February 29, 2020",Aristotle Abarintos
Perfection.,5.0,It cleaned so damn well! So happy with it. Hate the texture as I hate slime... But it works... Just not sure how to clean it? My car was dirty and it got it alllll haha,"May 5, 2020",crystal

Works great!,5.0,"Could do without a scent, but it's not very strong to begin with. It does work very well though. Picks dust up from all places. Will be getting this stuff again. One note, it did leave somewhat of a shine, not sure if thats just initial use and will dry up!?","October 20, 2020",Carbon
exactly as advertised,5.0,"This product worked exactly as advertised.  Picked up all the small and yucky stuff and washed off easily.  We let it dry itself in it's jar and worked just like new the second time, too.  It did a great job on my keyboard. Completely satisfied and prompt delivery.","September 8, 2020",john c.
Wondergoo!!,5.0,"This little jar of goo works exactly as described!! Easy to shape and use, lifts and traps dust and grime, not overly sticky on the hands, and can be rinsed and reused..great to keep in the car at all times! Recommended highly!!","October 29, 2020",mike ishmael
Picks up dirt and dust very well,5.0,I bought it to clean some of the dust in the awkward to clean places of my Jeep and dropped it on my muddy formats and they did a great job in picking up all the dirt from the floor. I think this product is disposable because there’s no way in cleaning it lol. 5 stars it works great,"August 6, 2020",Jason
Definitely cleans in nooks n crannies (not the internal kind).,5.0,"It's now full of all the dust from my air conditioners and fans and nooks n crannies (from my house, not my body). Its clearly got loads of gunk in it and it's still going strong! It's been a fun experiment of cleaning for what looks like the first time ever. I'm going to buy more. Maybe if I just leave them around, it'll collect all the dust like a magnet and I'll never have to clean again (which, I'll remind you that it seemed as if I hadn't when I saw all the gunk in the slime).","August 9, 2020",Jazz
I highly recommend.,5.0,"Such an amazing product, it literally works wonders, I bought it thinking it'd be useful but I was thoroughly impressed at how well it did what it was supposed to, takes off dust better than a wet cloth or a vacuum.","July 27, 2020",Brandon
Interesting product,4.0,The worst feature is that my step daughter wants to play with it as a slim  product. Works well as a product that was designed to pick up dust from odd places. Does a nice job and doesn't leave pieces stuck behind.,"August 8, 2020",Amazon Customer
Good cleaner,5.0,"Picks up all the dust and dirt on my laptop! Smells nice and doesn't leave any sticky residue. I only used a small portion but it still works even after multiple uses, so I'm quite sure this would last me a long time. Great product for the price","August 7, 2020",camg
reusable cleaner!!,5.0,"Great cleaner, bought it for the car to clean holders and doors. I have yet to get the hang of it as its a bit hard to use with single hand. But the idea is great . Cleans flawlessly. Above all reusable!!","August 23, 2020",Nikhil P
Does what it claims to do. Not a cheap product,3.0,Great consistency to work with when putting down on car vents. Doesn't become sticky and hard to handle. Returns to shape and ready for next task. Early days but like what it has been able to do so far,"October 3, 2020",julie

Must have when cleaning your car,5.0,This stuff works great to remove dust from all the nooks in your car. It even picked up stuff that the vacuum did not.  It has a very slimy texture and leaves a bit of a film behind that seems to disappear after it dries.,"October 21, 2020",Jen B.

Squishy cleaning magic,4.0,Ordered this for my car. It worked really well for those annoying little bits that a cloth can’t get to. The scent is nice the first few uses and it definitely fades the more gunk it picks up. To be expected though. Wear gloves while you’re using it or just be prepared to have dust goop slime leaving a residue all over yer hands. But super fun to squish. Will reorder for sure.,"October 21, 2020",Eleanor
Love this goo,5.0,"It does just what the commercials say. I was shocked! I'm only concerned how long it will last, since the dust is absorbed. Time will tell","August 20, 2020",Val Hunter
Too hard and thick,3.0,Its too hard and thick. Total opposite of what the description mentions about this product. It didn't grab any dust at all. This product is not sticky enough to stick on dust and too thick to clean the vents in my car.,"November 20, 2020",George Marji

It's a very cool product!,4.0,It was very easy to use and clean after using. I did find though that it was hard to make it cover my whole keyboard so I only did half once than the other half. it was easy to wash.,"August 20, 2020",Frank

Great product! 10/10 would recommend !,5.0,Absolutely fantastic product! Far exceeded my expections. My 7 year old car looks practically brand new after using this to clean.

Not happy with it.,1.0,This product doesn’t work. It’s more just like a slime. Waste of my time and money. I wouldn’t suggest anyone to order this product.

Just barely ok,3.0,It’s not much different than “slime” that you buy at the dollar store- maybe it is a bit thicker.  I bought it to clean the dash and vents of my car and for my key board but a small air compressor is much better.,"August 27, 2020",Diana Hughes

Plenty of storage capacity for random gadgets and cables,5.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought this mostly to organize all the random loose cables and small electronic accessories that are lying around the house. I must say I was surprised as how much I can fit in this bag. The elastic strap panel is great for me to organize all the random cables neatly and they are now easier to identify and access. The bag does bulk up quite a bit after I load it up with items, but it seems to hold up pretty well and feels quite sturdy. I don't think I have maxed out its capacity even after fitting all sorts of items in there. Overall, it really does serve what I sought out for.","August 31, 2020",Brian Lee
Great for a tech geek like me,5.0,"Honestly, I've needed this for a long time before and am sad I didn't get one sooner! It's perfect for storing all your screwdrivers, chargers, cord... and all tool you use for small homework. this organizer was just what I needed to organize them all and have them all stay in place and not be a tangled mess when I arrive to do a job. It is small enough to throw in my backpack or a small overnight bag to take with me or just to bury in my suitcase without taking up much room. The straps and pockets are perfect. The bag also provided protection so all doesn’t get damaged. That said, I love this bag, nice quality and I definitely recommand it!","August 21, 2020",Leo
Just what I needed to manage all my cords and cables.,5.0,"Just what I needed to manage all my cords and cables. Every device now has a power cord or a USB charger. I had my cords and USB cables all over the place not knowing what I have. This Electronics Organizer is great as now I know what I have and where to find the cords I need, instead of ordering new cables every time I can't find one. As you can see by the images there are lots of places to store stuff. There are also pockets to store stuff on the outside of the organizer. I emptied out two draws and other places of tangled cables. Great investment I should have got this a long time ago.","August 28, 2020",Maggie

It has so many spots to put cables / devices. The material feels very nice. It feels like a denim quality material. The zipper on it works well without getting caught up.

Great watch for kids,5.0,"My 5 year old came home from his 2nd year of school wanting a smart watch because some of his friends have one. So what does a father do when he keeps bugging you for over a week? He buys him the smart watch. This watch is a perfect fit for him. It has games, alarms, and obviously tells the time. He’s loving it and it feels great that it didn’t break the bank so when he does lose it, it won’t hurt so bad. It’s pretty easy to use and he’s got the hang of it down pat now.

Good choice for younger kids,5.0,"Ordered this for Christmas present for my 7y old who want smart watch for long time to be like his dad. He did not tested it yet, but I opened the watch, charged it and played with it for a little. Screen responding is great,colors are bright and clear. The watch has multiple watch faces to choose. There are 2 cameras, picture and video quality is as expected. The watch has a speaker, few kids games, flash light, and parental control for games. It is not adult watch, no heart rate or others fitness tracking gadgets but I believe my 7y will love it and it will fulfill his desire to have smart watch. I believe this is a good choice for smaller kid without a phone to connect regular smart watch.","November 14, 2020",kathyxy
Great gift idea,5.0,Purchased for a five year old who is learning to tell time. It was definitely a hit! She enjoys the games and figuring out how to tell time. Surprisingly she also really enjoys pushing numbers on the calculator alot and hopefully it helps her begin to learn math! Her favourite feature is the camera and is having a blast taking pictures and videos of everything. It takes decent enough pictures for what it is. The strap seems durable and its great being able to charge it instead of changing batteries. Overall a great gift for a kid to learn and have fun.,"October 11, 2020",Justin

"The the tutorial is helpful, but the quality of the component should be improved",3.0,"I bought this kit to practice my technical skills since I am an engineering student going to my master study. I like the tutorial provided since it's detailed and well organized. However, when I tried to implement the ADC module using the PCF8591 chip, the pi could not detect the address of the chip (using I2C communication). Then I found that the chip was not soldered properly. If this issue could be avoided in the future, the product would be better. If the user could not address the issue, they will be really disappointed after wasting lots of time trying to reconnect the wires and change the code. Just my suggestion.","August 5, 2019",Amazon Customer
It is like a dream of my childhood!,5.0,"The best pack to prepare one to dive in into world of IoT!  (and brush up on programming skills - especially with C) Two remarks: - boards are not very convenient -  and the way to create wires with soldering iron - is not a very efficient and neat, - it makes sense to port Python code to Python 3. (as it it more up to date) But overall - for this price - great stuff and (if you dedicate time and efforts) fully worth it.","November 7, 2018",igor topalov

My issue is the same as a previous reviewer that the quality might not be top notch.  For us the GPIO breakout and ribbon did not work.  These are key parts in our decision to buy this kit.

I bought this to learn about the raspberry pi. It is this that this kit does really well. The manual is very clear (though has the odd word of chinglish in there). The experiments are interesting. But most importantly the manual shows you how the Raspberry pi communicates in Python and C to its GPIO port and external electronics. This is exactly what I was after.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 12, 2018",D. Haigh
,,"Frankly, I don't know how they can provide this at the price. It comes in a 6"" x 9"" plastic case, crammed full of various quality bits and pieces - so full it's like a puzzle to get them all back in! The associated pdf tutorial (available to download on the Freenove website) is almost 300 pages and seems pretty comprehensive, has plenty of very clear colour illustrations of the 'this-goes-there, plug-this-in-here' type to get you started. There are basic informative wiki's on things like LED's, motors and stepper motors, and basic electronics. It also has circuit diagrams, and full listings in both 'c' and Python for the supplied program files, even a how-to on getting a Raspberry Pi going in the first place (but note the Pi is not included). Device datasheets are also provided. That said, I'm not sure it's for a *complete* beginner, if you have been using a Pi for a while and ideally know a little 'c' and/or Python, it would help. And it's fun... I wish I'd had one as a teenager !","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2019",Eccentric Inventor
,,"Amazing plastic box with loads of quality components. The downloaded tutorials are superb ,easy to understand and work you through step by step. The only fly in the ointment was that the bar led didn't work so presumed it faulty. Contacted Freenove and had a prompt reply and help and are in the process of replacing it for me. There are no labels on the items so takes a bit of working out what is what. I first off started to write the python script in but found that spacing are so critical that it takes quite a bit of messing about altering the script in order to make it run. I have resorted to running their downloaded code which is really easy to get things going but not so good in teaching Python coding. I wholeheartedly recommend this kit for anyone interested in learning small electronic projects using the Raspberry Pi and Python code.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 1, 2018",M E Soons
,,"Really great kit, great price and no cheap components. Very pleased with the neat case it all comes in and the amount of projects you can make with this kit. Most items carefully packed in anti-static bags and the LCD panel is brilliant. Would absolutely recommend this if you want to build and test lots of different projects with the Raspberry Pi.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on October 4, 2018",P. F. Bailey

It is very useful for her. When she runs, she liked to use my phone to check how fast she runs. This smart watch can instead of All she wants by herself. She also learn to set how long she finishes her lunch or dinner because it works to improve her eating time.  She sets the alarm for her until she wake up and stop everyday. She  likes to Play the games in the watch but I will use the parental control function to control the times.

Very cool for the price,4.0,"I purchased one for each of my kids and first impressions are good. The GUI is simple and fast, and they are a blast. At 10 I would have lost my mind to get one of these to play with rather than a bouncy ball on a paddle. The only negative so far is that the speaker is very underwhelming for listening to mp3's etc.","October 24, 2020",Daniel S.
I recommend for anyone with a anxious child under 6,5.0,Really good watch for kids. My daughter played with it for a week then she was bored of it. But for long car rides and for a kid that gets bored easily it's a good thing to have. The watch itself was great but for a older kid it's to simple. I'd recommend for a kid under the age of 6,"October 9, 2020",Joscelyne Bennett

Very pleased with this travel case.,5.0,"I don't have a lot of technical stuff to take so this bag is perfect for me.  It will hold up to six cords and has 3 small pouches and two large zippered pouches for larger items like chargers.  It lies very flat which is what I wanted for travel.  A nice surprise was that it came with velcro ties - 4 in red, green, blue and yellow.  There is a small slot for a sim card or other small item. The only thing I noticed was that the two inside zippers were flimsy.  One zipper actually pulled apart in the middle as I was inspecting it but I was able to get it back together.  The outside zipper seems fine.  This bag was inexpensive so I am not surprised.  I will keep it because I won't be putting anything too big in those pouches. It is made in China but as long as it does what I need it to I am fine with that.","February 20, 2020",Ame
There are a few things I would have liked to see but they aren't a deal breaker,4.0,"This Organizer bag is actually quite helpful especially when on the go. There are a few things I would have liked to see but they aren't a deal breaker. For one there aren't many sd, microsd or tf card pouches which would have been nice to have considering the USB Drive compartments work like a charm. Overall the size is quite good, the material seems durable, and the zipper does seem sturdy. That being said it will take some time of usage before that will show its weakness. The cable organizer section and battery pouch are actually very good. It took me a while to figure out how they'd like me to use some of the pouches and straps (little to no information sent with it) but that wasn't a big issue in the end of it. Currently, I'd recommend this product.","August 20, 2018",Philipp zu Putlitz
This organizer was amazing. It fit all my wires for my phone,5.0,"This was absolutely life-saving product! I desperately needed to find a case that fit all of my electronics (especially because airport security always needs this in one bag). This organizer was amazing. It fit all my wires for my phone, iPod, gopro, and external battery charger. It fit my usb and SD cards perfectly (none of them ever fell out, which is what i was worried about). I think the best part about this item is the depth of it. I was able to fit my gopro camera case, an external battery charger, gopro battery charger ((for 2 batteries). I then squeezed in my gopro camera right at the front in the pocket. I would definitely recommend buying this product to anyone out there looking for an organizer!","August 10, 2018",Violeta M.
I like this bag - so handy!,5.0,"This bag came quickly and I really find it helpful for organizing all my charging cords (iPhone, ipad, spare battery charging cords), spare batteries for the electronics and USB flashdrives.  It also holds my ipad mini no problem.  It does not fit my mac book air charging cord but that is because I have stuffed so much other electronic pieces into it.  I love it.  It is so easy to just pull this bag out when going through security at the airport as well as when getting to my seat on the plane.  Lots of people have asked where I got it since it is so handy to have all this little cords and supplies in one handy place.  You do have to be careful that the elastic will loosen over time so be careful when opening it to make sure nothing has shifted.  Nice and slim and fits in my backpack when travelling.","October 24, 2018",smc
great organizer,5.0,"the bag is well made, i had a slight problem with the zippers, however the seller was very responsive and the problem was resolved by replacing the item with another one that had everything working just fine. the bag is not of a very big size, however everything that was normally bouncing on the bottom of my over-the-shoulder bag and around my car has nicely fit it and now seems organized. i am very pleased with the way the seller responded to my complain about zippers, eventhough it hasn't been a disastrous defect. i totally recommend the item to those in need of a mid-sized electronic accessories organizer.","July 16, 2017",Timour Savine
Good Performance For The Price,5.0,"PROS 1) Quality Build: good stiching with strong zipper. 2) Multiple Configurations: lots of options for small cables, large power blocks and everything in between. 3) Versatile: can be used to store a variety items ranging from electronics to school supplies. 4) Ample Space: large enough to carry electronics to meet the needs of 5 people. CONS 1) Plastic protection film difficult to remove.","April 3, 2019",Aaron D
This is built pretty well. My only real complaint is the size,4.0,"This is built pretty well.  My only real complaint is the size.  Thought things would fit a little better.  Its missing about 1/2'' to 1'' width.  Most wires just fit if you squeeze them in.  I would recommend this if you just have a few things you are carrying.  But if your like me and have an ereader, memory cards, charging cable, earphones, card reader, battery pack, and a few other small electronic devices then you may want to look at a larger case.  Otherwise this one just might do the trick","November 9, 2017",Jeffrey Clement
Perfect to organized all your cables for travelling,5.0,"Perfect addition to organize all your cables, SD Cards, USBs, charging cables, and chargers - all in one compact package. Glad I got the larger one for the extra room and it doesn't feel ""too big"".  While this was initially intended for travel, I'm thinking I will keep everything stored in here all the time so that I'm not searching for my various cables.","October 18, 2019",BlueZoom09
decent organizer,5.0,If you're like me and have a lot of thumb-drives and cables etc then this book is for you.. Being organized is a great feeling and nothing worse than have a spiders nest of wires. Great gifts for anyone who has a lot of dongles and sort.. Price is good and so is the quality. highly recommend this to anyone who has clutter in their life,"October 11, 2020",R.Stock
Perfect for my needs!,5.0,"I have several electronics and accessories that I'd like to keep in the same place, and I travel with them as well. Fits my mouse, external hard drive, huge power bank, surface charger, iPad, headphones case, misc cables and still room for more. My husband is the same so he had me order one for himself. Just got it yesterday so not sure what the wear and tear will be like.","July 4, 2018",Ramona
"Organize your cables, adapters and more",5.0,"You know all those cables you acquire all twisted and bunched up like the Christmas lights in the Christmas Vacation movie, well start organizing. Now can find the cable I need when I need it. I also include all my various adapters and charging cables. I should have done this sooner. Check that the size of this case works for you. I felt that it was a tad smaller then I was expecting.","October 10, 2018",Patrick L.
Very Good...But,5.0,"Rating this 5 Stars, because everything is accurate about it as per description and specs.  However, from the pictures I was expecting it to be a little thicker than it actually is.  Specs on the site is correct, however be advised that the pics make it look thicker than it actually is.  Other than the size, I rate it 5/5.  I really wanted something a little bigger though :(","July 27, 2020",Kunal
super amazing electronics bag!,5.0,"this is an amazing little electronics bag. The best one I've had. so much room for everything and keeps the clutter away! The first one i got had a flaw in the mesh so I've returned it, got a refund and ordered another no problem all in 3 days. i will be buying the smaller version as well!","April 6, 2019",Andrea
Great value and well made.,5.0,"My only issue is the design of the bag makes the interior dimensions actually smaller than advertised. I did purchase a larger bag from same company and seller. The sticking on the bags is nice, clean and well done. I would definitely continue to buy the BAGSMART products.","October 14, 2019",Simon
etc in order and easily accessible. I tend to have a lot of ...,4.0,"The only downside is that it is smaller than I thought it would be. I know it gave dimensions but still looks smaller than the pictures. Haven't measured the bag itself but I'm sure it matches the description. I can't say anything about longevity as I've only had it for a while now. The bag does work as intended and helps keep all my cables, charges, etc in order and easily accessible. I tend to have a lot of electronic items on me when I travel and it pretty much fits everything I need although it's not bug enough to also include my laptop cable and power brick or mouse. Could be a couple inches bigger in each dimension, at least for me. Excellent purchase so far and I recommend it for anyone who carries a lot of electronic peripherals.","January 31, 2018",Nodscene
Decent case,4.0,"Package arrived quickly and in good condition.  The bag appears to be of good construction.  Only issue I have, and it's my own problem, is that it is a little smaller than I expected.  USB cables just bunch up more in the smaller space, but I have only a few so not a big concern.","September 15, 2019",Paul Andre Lallier
As advertised: Well-built travel bag that organizes small electronics,5.0,"This is a cool little bag that seems to be well built. Organizes a variety of cables and small electronics, putting them within sight - much nicer than digging through a tangle of cords to find the one you're looking for. Love that the sides have enough depth to accommodate all the items zipped inside; exterior pocket and pouches are also appreciated. Very happy with this purchase.","January 8, 2019",Wiser Owl
Hold so many things,5.0,"Feels premium.  I can throw this in my backpack and takes care of all my cables charges etc.  I was skeptical about it fitting my Ipad (9.7"") and slim folio with it full of a portable ssd, cables etc but it fits!  I will probably try other bagsmart products if they are like this.","September 26, 2019",Brett
Cool little tech bag,5.0,"I bought this bag to hold my tech stuff and it does a pretty good job at it. It has plenty of pockets and compartments to hold everything I need. I store charging cables, spare phone batteries, my earbuds, flash drives and my portable hard drive in here. My only issue is that the row of little pockets on the inside are too small to hold many things. If you need a bag to hold your tech I definitely suggest this one. If you want a more in depth look at the bag I suggest you go to YouTube and search uravgconsumer tech survival kit 2.0. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking to hold their tech.","May 21, 2017",John
Big yet compact,5.0,"I'm using this bag to store all my smaller accessories for field photography and travel abroad. It can take a lt of small to medium size gadgets and accessories, wires, batteries, memory cards, USB drives, filters, etc. The design is great, quality is impeccable, the fabric and the zippers will last for sure.","August 24, 2017",Benoit Rainville
"Overall, what I had hoped for. A little smaller than I expected.",5.0,"After reviewing a bunch of competitors, I felt like this was the product being compared to, which was what made my decision. It looks strong so far. Good quality and build. Good strong zippers, materials, and stitching. There's one photo in the product photos of the Bagsmart being stuffed into a backpack which made it look bigger than it is. I almost didn't buy it because it looked too big from my needs. I decided I could crush it down if need be, but it looks like that won't be an issue. So far, happy with this purchase.","February 17, 2019",Warren S.
Amazing,5.0,"Bought this as our last trip was a cluster of cords and chargers. These types of bags have come a long ways, suspected them to be poorly laid out but I was very impressed. We fit a large inverter power bar, tablet, all our cords, memory cards, and charging bricks in here with room to spare, Super cool!","May 18, 2018",Mikayla Fisher
Well Made,4.0,"A very well made bag, which holds a surprising amount of cords! I could have gone up one size to hold all my cords, but I still managed to fit it all into this smaller model....just a little tight. This is great for home cord storage and travel/business.","February 27, 2019",sdt1
Great Product...Not worth $25,3.0,"Great little bag. You will notice when it arrives this is worth about $10 at most. lots of great spots for all small cables and headphones. Mine has small usb brick for iphone, 4 charging cords, 2 earbuds, travel power adapter, 4000mah power bank, aux cord, ground loop isolator, pens, and usb flash drive.","December 10, 2018",Jay
Good quality but too small,4.0,"It's good quality, but turned out to be too small for my need. So I ordered a larger one from Amazon which is perfect. Should have realized I had more stuff than what this travel organizer can hold.","May 7, 2020",ecmisera

This case is very compact and strong!!,5.0,"I bought this for work. I work in film and we are constantly taking continuity photos every day.

Seems relatively durable. I should have gotten a bigger ...,4.0,"Seems relatively durable. I should have gotten a bigger size as this is very tight. Labels should be more generic as not everyone carries SD cards with them (I have more USB sticks for example). Other than that, it keeps stuff neat in one spot. Just what the doctor ordered.","February 16, 2018",Sam Stratigeas
Great bag for techno supplies and cords,5.0,"This bag is perfect size for traveling and also just to use around the house. It holds plenty of cords, adapters and extras and is well made with water proof type nylon material. I am planning to buy a couple more.","January 30, 2018",Highland Lass
Undeniable Organization Capabilities,5.0,This bag is amazing! It's so small yet so well laid out and compact. It provides a crazy amount of organization.

,,"You have to email the company for a PDF file to get the instructions.  The packaging is ridiculous.  Talk about cramming 10 pounds of crap in a 5 pound bag.  Not to mention when I was opening the box the kit fell from my coffee table to a shag carpet floor and the plastic case shattered like I dropped a Christmas ornament on a concrete floor.  That was a freaking mess.  I had to go buy a little parts case from the hardware store.  So add another $7 to the kit right there. The whole thing is geared toward Arduino learning, but it doesn't come with and Arduino board and the AD on Amazon doesn't really tell you that it doesn't come with an Arduino Board.  Maybe it does tell you, but I do not have 3 hours to research an electronics learning tool.  I personally didn't learn that the whole thing was worthless without the Arduino board until I placed the order and finally received the PDF file.  It also requires an uncommon USB cable to power it up.  I am sure there is a reason for that, but they don't provide the cable or any adapters so you are on a search for an uncommon cable that you have to BUY or rig one up yourself (which is what I did with 2 old cell phone chargers).  I had to cut 2 cords off the cell phone chargers and splice them together.  Sorry Wayin Top, but I do not recommend your product.  Not to mention the shipment got lost in the mail.  I finally got it about 2 weeks after the original delivery date promised. Buy a kit with the Arduino board and instructions included.  This one has been nothing but delay after delay. I had to wait for: Wait for the shipment.  Wait for the PDF email with the instructions (that's freaking ridiculous).  Search for an uncommon power cord or make your own.  Wait for that to come in if you buy it.  Search for an Arduino board.  Pay and wait for the Arduino board.  Who knows what else I will have to search and wait for.  100% disappointed.  This was a gift for my son's birthday.  he is interested in RC, robotics, and drone technology.  The shipment missed his birthday and it wouldn't have mattered anyway because we had no power supply or instructions when it finally did show up.","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020",Christopher IXer
,,"This kit includes a lot of essential components for a low price, but there is a noticeable lack of quality. A few examples: - Some of the jumpers have leftover injection molded pieces hanging on near the ends, so you have to snip those off or else they will get in the way. The jumpers are also quite thin, so thin that my cat chomped one in half with one bite. - The breadboard terminals are often difficult to get connected. Some of them are loose and your wires will accidentally slip out, some are very stiff and you have to use a lot of force to get it to snap in (sometimes bending your component in the process). - The resistors are poorly labelled and the striping system used to determine how many Ohms it has is not the typical system. Besides these issues, it works OK and I like the little box it comes with to keep everything together. The difficulty of the breadboard is really annoying though, so that's the main reason I'm only giving it 3 stars.","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020",Cat

Tested 1 year then removec,3.0,"Product arrived quickly and was easy to install. Now been five or six weeks since installation. My well water hardness is 21 grains. There has been some improvement. Water feels softer in shower. Rate of hard water scale is diminished, however still getting lime scale build up in electrical kettle. Not as fast as before, but still need to use vinegar to clean it. Manufacturer says to wait three months for full effect. For an inexpensive descaler it seems ok, time will tell. I suspect water that is less hard than mine responds better to the unit. I may still go out and purchase a water softener..... UPDATE Aug 17 2020. I have removed this unit after over a year of service. I really can't see any difference.

,,"Measured hardness professionally  before installing. It was 210 - very hard. Will come back to this feedback every week to see changes and report. For tight spaces you have to know the length of the coil before installation. On 3/4"" pipe it's 4.25"". Also you don't know if you can cross red and blue wires as they come out of the box because in my setup water flow is from right to left. So my box is facing wall not to cross them. In seven days hardness dropped to 160 ppm. Will be coming back to this once a week to tell what changed. Second week brought hardness to 140 ppm. Manual is saying though that unit ""will not affect hardness measured by traditional test"" and with this type of water conditioner the results can be measured by observing changes in scale forming areas. So I'll report any changes as I see them. In three weeks it's 130 ppm.It looks like the ball on the bottom of my electrical kettle is still shiny, I had to clean it monthly with vinegar or baking soda.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018",Tester

,,"(Updated to address claims for 1 month and 3 months) I live in a very small house where there is no room for a full house water softener, so I decided to try this descaler. I placed it on my PEX pipe right before it branched off to its various locations, all well within the 50 foot limit, probably within 30 feet. The installation was simple, as others have mentioned. The most difficult part was laying in a small crawlspace while winding the wires around the pipe. Day 1: More lather - This is the first time I've seen lather since I moved here and this was with the first shower after installation. I knew at that moment that the descaler was working. Week 1: Breaking down scale on water heater heating element and water pipes - My water heater is only a year old, but was losing the ability to maintain hot water. After one week, this issue has been fully resolved. No more lukewarm showers. Week 2: Loosening of scale on faucets and showerheads - My faucets are no longer developing stalactites,  and sink drains are not coated with white, crusty film. 1 Month: Less time for water to heat; reduction of scale on showerheads, pipes, and faucets - I see a noticeable reduction in scale on my showerhead and faucets, and have had no need to clean them beyond general cleaning, no more scraping away crust. I've also seen a significant amount of scale come out of the faucets (I remove and check monthly, with the first month resulting in large chunks of scale). 3 Months (I'm addressing just 2 months in since these issues have already been resolved): Disappearance of scale from showerheads; scaly crust in toilets is significantly reduced and no new crust should form - True on both claims. The most amazing was the total disappearance of scaly crust in the toilet, which has been an annoyance since I lived here. It looks brand new now and requires only normal cleaning. I am very pleased and surprised at this simple solution.  This product has resolved a handful of issues that I've had with hard water. Without room to install a water softener, this little gadget has saved the day.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2018",Ozark Vegan
,,"It almost seems too good to be true. We moved into a new house to later find that the municipal water was very hard. Calcium deposits on the dishes, dishwasher, fixtures and shower glass. But the worst part is what it does to your hair. My family was fed up with feeling as if the shampoo never really got out of our hair. I did a ton of research and we don’t have the space for a typical water softener system. So I bought the iSpring ED2000 on Amazon and installed it on the incoming cold water supply under my house. The directions were very straight forward and the whole process was almost too easy. I purposely installed it in a location so I could peek through the crawl space access to make sure the lights are still flickering but that’s about as much maintenance as this thing needs. Amazing! Two weeks after installation, all of the symptoms described above were gone.","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2018",TypicalConsumer777
,,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I was originally looking at a typical salt-based water softener solution but I was very reluctant to do that since it needs constant attention for adding/maintaining the salt. I decided to risk the ~$150 on this solution just in case it worked as advertised. I've had the device installed for a little more than 90 days now. I have seen a definite reduction in hard water deposits around my sinks and fixtures. But the bigger indication that this thing actually works are the dishes in the dishwasher. Before I installed this I ran the dishwasher and the glasses would all have a ""white"" discoloration from the hard water. It was so bad we had stopped using our dishwasher. I just ran the dishwasher on a few loads of dishes and the glasses came out sparkling clear. They looked like new glasses. I honestly did not actually expect this thing to work very well. But happily, I was wrong so now I have no need in my house for the salt-based water softener, thank goodness. An odd thing is I have an electronic water hardness meter that I bought at the same time I got this unit. I measured the hardness of the water before I installed the unit and I've been measuring it every couple of weeks. I've not seen any significant change in that reading but the end result is the annoying bits of hard water are no longer annoying. It claims the inside of the hot water heater and other systems are getting cleared out too. I don't know if that is truly happening or not but based on other external evidence I am inclined to believe it is working there too. I used to help my mom and dad carry those salt bags to their basement and fill the water softener. I am very glad not to have to do that in my house.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2018",yepher

,,So far so good.  The descaler has been installed for one month.  The install was straight forward and easy. As far as the performance: I have this installed in a ranch with a pretty long run between the supply and the water heater (over 50 feet).  I found a video from a spring that says the effectiveness of the ionization only lasts for about 50 feet.  I wish this information was more clearly presented on Amazon and in their install guide. That being said within a few days I felt like I noticed more particles being worked loose from the pipes and water heater.  No drastic improvement yet but water scales do seem to be more of a powder deposit than a scale (my water is hard due almost entirely to calcium). For the price and what it seems to do I think it is worth it.  Do your research and check the run of your pipes first.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2018",Brian and Megan S.

I have not noticed descaling at this point but I am sure it will take the approx. recommended time for the process to be as efficient as possible.

Before installing this, in only 1 day there would be a white calcium film covering the bottom of the kettle. After a couple days it's a complete layer that needs to be vinigered to be cleaned. I installed this thing and now it takes days, even a week to form the calcium film on the bottom of the kettle. But even more surprising is it doesn't build up. It even keeps self cleaning and knocking off parts of the film down to bare metal. Very cool. My shower head constantly clogged up and I would use my nails to unclog weekly.

Therefore, the only solution is a salt-less system. I looked up a number of high end salt-less systems, but they are $1000+ and seem to have very mixed reviews. As such, I figured at just over $100 the ISpring system seemed like a worthwhile alternative to try out, especially considering their satisfaction guarantee. As such, I went ahead & purchased one & installed it about 6 months ago.  Installation was very easy, just wrap the wires around the incoming water pipe tightly & plug it in.  I also cleaned all the calcium on my faucets & showerheads. Immediately I felt as if the water was a bit softer & the soap a little slicker when showering.  This isn't a huge difference, like a salt system would create, but it does seem that there is a small perceivable difference.  With 6-months under my belt, I can also say that all of my faucet taps & showerheads remain unclogged.  It's hard to say for sure, but I believe before I had this system the small jets on the showerhead would have clogged up well before 6-months after a thorough cleaning. Realizing the system doesn't take any hardness out of the water, but rather, keeps the hardness from adhering to appliances & surfaces is key.  If you don't come into this expecting the results that a salt-system would create, then you'll likely notice the results. In my experience the results aren't enormous, but they do exist & I feel they are worth the relatively small cost of the system.","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2019",Steve207

After 9 months and no visible signs of less scale, I now have to replace this with a more traditional water treatment system.  After submitting a warranty request I was asked to provide pictures of the installation, stating that most problems are due to improper installation.  Well, the user manual is pretty easy to follow (you would have to be mentally challenged to make a mistake) regarding the proper installation.  It was already removed, anyway and there was no previous notice of this requirement for warranty.  So, I fully expect that they will not honor the warranty.

,,"I have been cleaning water spots on my sinks and taps for almost twenty years in CA because I did not know that this product exists!! Just over three weeks ago while visiting family up north, I commented on how spotless their sinks and hardware are,  this product became conversation. They had used a salt softener before but felt it was wasteful, due to flushing, etc. and after much research came to use the Eddy 2000. Almost immediately, I wanted to order that, but since it wasn't available, I opted for this brand. The concept is similar, and I have to say, this one is about $50 cheaper. So almost two weeks in, I have to write this review so this company stays in business and I can buy more when I get another house!!! I love it so much, it does what it says. Now my sinks are spotless without obsessive wiping and cleaning. I like it also that it does not filter out all the necessary elements that is in water as I do not want distilled water.  It is super easy to install, once you figure out the flow of your water.

,,"I purposely waited a few months before reviewing this item as I wanted to be sure it's doing what it says; and frankly that's not an easy question to answer.  Install is fairly straight forward.  Just follow the instructions and wrap the wires in the direction of water flow as described.  Plug it in and then....what?  Unless you can get inside your boiler there's no way of knowing for sure the deposits are being released into the water stream.  You would have to wait 5-10 or more years to see if you get more life out of your water tank.  Here in CO we have hard water w/ lots of minerals; my last water heater lasted about 7 years so I still have several years to go to see if this product extends the life of the new boiler. Barring testing water prior to installation and after (which I did not do), how can one tell if this thing is working?  First, the science is there.  I researched quite a bit before purchasing and multiple sources indicate this product does descale minerals from pipes and water tank.  Second, it's hard to be sure but when standing in the shower it does seem the water feels a bit softer on skin.  Rubbing fingers together under a flow of water seems slicker and smoother than prior to installation.  The problem is this could be a psychological effect of ""wanting it to work""...hard to be certain.  Finally, and most notably for me is how my skin has reacted over time.  CO winter air is beyond dry.  The years I've lived here I need humidifiers constantly running, bottles of lotion used and still would be itchy most of the day.  This winter however there is a noticeable improvement.  My skin is not nearly as dry, I am not using lotion like I was and I do not itch anymore.  For me this is the true indicator that the product is working.  I'm not going to call it 'soft water', but it has the same effect as soft water which is all that matters to me.  For the price this was a good solution and totally worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019",T. Shepard
,,"I don't fully understand how this unit accomplishes the separation of calcium and magnesium to minimize and reduce scaling, buts its a great salt-free alternative at a tremendous cost savings if it works as represented. The company offers a very generous warranty for the product and their reviews are exceptional. In my instance, this is one part of a three part system, that has already enabled cleaner and clearer water that my family now has no hesitation drinking. ISpring states that reduction of scaling will become noticeable over a reasonable time duration. I am optimistic that it will and have awarded the stars in advance based somewhat upon their reputation and reported customer service. I will supplement this review if issues occur that change my rating. Edit: IMPORTANT: The instructions that come with the unit have a one page diagram of how to install it. The diagram shows a water flow direction with how to install the wires around a water pipe. In the same manual it states in Placement question one, page 5, ""It does not matter"" which way the water is flowing. In reviewing comments on this site, I see some folks have crossed wires to comport with the installation diagram. THIS was confusing to me and I installed my unit without crossing leads even though my water flow came from the right instead of left as diagrammed--based on the answer to Placement question one, ""that it makes no difference which way the water flows. Today I talked to a customer a service representative who confirmed that water direction doesn't matter, but instructed me that if the water flows from right to left with the unit facing me (opposite as shown in the diagram, which I imagine at least half do, the remedy is to reverse the installation of the leads-- by reversing the direction of the leads. Instead of installing the downstream red wire starting under the pipe; install it going over. Install the upstream blue lead going under the pipe instead of going over. Customer service was cordial from ISpring, but I hope they will include a simple caveat on their installation page informing the above fix. Otherwise, the answer the first placement question on page 5 of their brochure guide should be that it does, or might, matter. I have no opinion as to what crossing the electromagnetic leads will or won't do.","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2019",John Barrow-Native South Texan

,,"We live in a 120m2 apartment in Italy and since completely remodeling it in 2015 (all new plumbing, electrics, the whole works) I have had to descale the faucet filters and shower heads every two weeks. Our plumber installed a magnetic descaler at the inlet to the hot water storage cylinder 18 months ago but this made little difference. This year we decided it was time to find an effective solution and were thinking of a conventional, high-maintenance whole-house system but, due to the limited space available where the supply enters our apartment, knew it would be a challenge. A search on Amazon's Italian site turned up the ""usual suspects"", but I noticed several systems from iSpring so went to their website for more info in english and there discovered the ED2000. This seemed to meet our particular needs but it isn't offered on Amazon Italy so I ordered a unit via Amazon.com, knowing the power supply is 110V but no problem as I have had a 240V-110V step-down transformer for many years. The unit arrived in 3 days (well done Amazon logistics!!), well packed, clearly a quality product from a serious company and was installed the next day. As you can see from the 2nd & 3rd pics, space is extremely tight but with considerable patience I was able to get both cables wound - even if the red isn't perfectly tight. It is now 12 days since the system commenced operation and we have both noticed better hot water pressure with no drop-off over a few days as the faucet filters load up. The shower heads are also much better, with no calcium build-up evident over at all - previously they were starting to block after a week. The ED2000 is the optimum solution for the water composition we have in central-west Italy (1 hour from Rome on the Tyrrhenian Sea). We expect to see continued improvement over time and look forward to many years of decent, soft water.

,,"Let me first say that I prepared for this purchase by researching the recommendations the manufacturer had mad before buying it. I knew I needed water within a certain hardness range, <3 ppm iron, and that it would only be good for 50 ft of pipe after the wrap. I tested my water and it was all good so I went ahead and bought it. Luckily, I have two water inlets to my house because one end is an addition. This allowed me to easily install the unit while observing the 50ft pipe rule. I have a total of maybe 30 ft of pipe after the install, with the hot water heater being within 10 feet. Within the first week I noticed that the water felt different and my soap was getting my hands cleaner. I used to wash my hands and have a slick feeling like my hands were oily still (I have oily skin/hands) but I noticed that when I would wash my hands they were very ""sticky"". Not really like I have syrup on my fingers, but if I tried to slide my fingers against each other after washing and drying them, they'd feel more like I washed my hands with something that took off all the oils. This is very anecdotal and not really something you can say is a definitive thing that a person might think is just in my head, so now for the hard evidence. I have a mirror in the shower that I use for shaving. I have to scrub it with gritty toothpaste every time I use it to clean off the deposits. It takes about a week for it to build up to the point that I clean it. Well I installed this after I didn't shave for about 6 weeks and decided to touch up a little after it had been installed for a month. I cleaned off the mirror with toothpaste and got to work. I decided that maybe this could be my test and started checking it weekly to see how it was going. So far the only thing that sticks to the mirror looks like soap scum (I have my bar on a caddy that has a hook below it where the mirror hangs) and I can just wet it and wipe it off. Maybe it's minerals but they aren't sticking to the point that they require anything to remove. Just my hand and water. This is all I wanted from this thing. Reduce the deposits that were difficult to clean/remove and hopefully extend the life of my hot water heater element. I had a brand new hot water tank when we moved into this house, and after 8 months the element was toast and the bottom of the tank was full of deposits that I had a hard time removing (read chisel, vinegar, and many flushes). I have had this installed for about 3 months so it's not been near long enough to tell how it works for the longevity of the hot water heater, but it's worth it for the cleaning hassles with the fixtures. My wife loves it. All in all I'd recommend it 100% if your water meets the requirements or can be conditioned to meet them. Otherwise, I have no idea, but I doubt it'll work outside what the manufacturer says it will. I will be buying another one to install on the other water inlet to the house, which is the one that supplies the kitchen.","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020",Jordie

Best mini screwdriver set,5.0,I have bought several mini screwdriver set from the internet and by far this one is the best. The handle is made of aluminum alloy with an anti-slip coating which is great compared to the steel plactic handles I bought before.  Those handles can be slippery at times especially when my hand was sweating.  The turncap design is good to have so instead of turning with your wrist you may turn with your fingers as long as you have the turncap fasten with your palm.  That makes your work more efficient when you have many screws to deal with. Included in the set are 48 magnetic S2 tool steel bits which are the jewels of the set.  The bit heads are very tuff and do not chip or strip when you are trying to unscrew a rusted or jammed screws. The bit heads from my other sets had chipped and striped which is very frustrating.  The bits are also magnetic which is great because it makes it so much easier to handle the small screws instead of my fat fingers.  And because the bits are magnetic they seldom fall out of the handle or sleeves.,"January 5, 2019",Danny

"Quality screwdriver set with all the oddball mini bits (pentalobe, triwing)",5.0,"I needed a few mini screwdrivers for some repair work including Apple's pentalobe (for MacBook Pro) and a Triwing for a Nintendo switch. Having purchased these types of drivers before and been unsatisfied with poor quality that stripped out or were badly machined I dug around an found this kit which looked nice and had good reviews for quality. I was pleased when it arrived and found all these things to be true. It's a compact case with almost every conceivable bit you could need for electronics repair. The bits themselves are high quality, well machined, accurate and seem very durable. The driver itself is quite small and thin so not the most ergonomic handle but you're not going to be reefing on the torque with tiny fasteners so it's suitable to task. The case is a nice bonus. It's nice and compact and the bits are held in magnetically so easy to remove and store (unlike some blow-moulded cases which you have to struggle with). The driver itself snaps in rather than magnetic. A bonus is the bits have a small magnetic charge which helps hold small screws in place while working. Everything slides into the aluminum sleeve (with plastic endcap) which has a spring loaded 'button' to pop it open.

This set had the Y 0.6 bit and worked perfectly without stripping the screw. Compact case that is a push lock close.,"January 18, 2019",Dark-Knight23
Sweet screwdriver set,5.0,"I was very impressed with the build quality and design of this screwdriver set. The magnetic box holds the screw heads nicely in place, but is still easy to remove needed screw head. The case has a sweet click in lock, which ensures the screwdriver and the head holder/plate stays inside the cover even if flipped upside down. One thing i really liked about the screw heads are that they don't easily strip the screw heads thread. I used it on my laptop screws and noticed that the the damage was minimal when i used the wrong screw head. That being said, the screw heads tend to easily wear out, but i prefer that over a damaged screw as those are harder to replace if the head is destroyed, especially in devices with small screw heads like a laptop.","January 17, 2019",Hari Govind
Great set of bits for electronics repair in a compact case.,4.0,"The set of bits is great and is well organized and labelled in a nice compact case. The durability is questionable, not great for screws that require some torque to break. Also the magnets that keeps the bit in fell out the second time I used it. Easily fixed with some crazy glue. But the security/proprietary bit selection is fantastic and should get you into any device that would prefer you not open it. My only complaint is the type of steel the bits are made of is brittle, and the magnet falling out after only my second laptop repair proves there is room for improvement in QC.  This type of steal is not THAT BAD, and I have seen it used in tools that were intended for more heavy duty application (including some Gerber Multi Tools, where every bit broke, including the blade). So for the intended use case, I think it's acceptable material, and often I'd rather have a the bit damaged than the screw stripped, so it's a give and take. 5 stars for value for money though.","December 31, 2019",CDT
"Ok, so you get what you pay for...",2.0,"The kit is ok for the price. Tons of bits and accessories. They honestly look flimsy but i plan to make 'light' usage of it. Hexagonal drivers are not deep enough to accomodate raspberry pi hexagonal posts that have a male end. This is why i bought this kit in the first place so, bummer. I would have expected the driver to act as a ratchet (click-click-click), unfortunatly it is fully 'manual'. Bummer #2. Also, i find the pictures of this set to be misleading because it shows both 'halves' of the box side by side as if it was opening like a 'book' but it's not. They have taken pictures of both the front and the back and put them side-by-side to make it look like it's opening like a book. If i knew this i would not have buy because it is not practical to have to flip it back and forth each time you want to change accessory while working with it.","October 29, 2020",Philippe B.
Litterally has everything a screwdriver set needs and more,4.0,"I got this screwdriver set because I realized my current set doesn't have enough bits to be used for everything and I'm the kind of guy that wants to have ALL the bits just in case I ever need it. And oh man, this set is the one to get. One day it just popped up on my Amazon page and when I saw it and saw the price I was shocked at how much value I can get for around $20. So I immediately bought it! When I first opened it I was so impressed by the amount of things it came with. As you can see from the photos it comes with TONS of different bits and even comes with an extension tool that makes the screwdriver longer. And some of the other tools it came with I have no idea what it's for but I'm sure I'll find some use for it when the time comes. I've owned it for about a month now and have used it quite a few times since then. I used it to fix my computer, projector, open cabinets and other things around the house and I can say that this is truly a screwdriver of all trades. Any screw you can think of this screwdriver set has something for it. The only downside is that after using it for a while I can start to feel it breaking apart and getting worned out since it seems like it's made from cheap materials and the built is a bit flimsy. So hopefully it won't break on me anytime soon. Overall, if you use it carefully it will be the only screwdriver set you'll need.","May 28, 2020",Wayne
Great hobby set,5.0,"I'm very happy with this set. The screwdriver is a good weight and the bits fit perfectly and securely into the magnetic slot. There is a free moving end to rest on your palm and freely rotate the screwdriver which is easily my favourite part of this set. It moves so nicely. The bits came slightly lubricated which is very nice and shows attention to detail. There are more bits than I will probably ever use and they are all very clearly labeled with their size laser etched on each bit. There are clear symbols on the case to indicate the type of bit that is in the slot so it's very easy to find the bit you need. The bits are all held into the case magnetically but are also easy to take out. I love this set and at around $18 I am beyond thrilled. I bought this set to work on my 3d printer, which mostly has hex. I have more than enough sizes for this. This set has made it much easier to work on my 3d printer :)","August 30, 2020",Christina
"Electric  Screwdriver set, Versatile home improvement acessory",5.0,I wanted to get an electronic screwdriver set to ease my home improvement work and decided to give this new product a try after going through its specifications. This electric screwdriver set consists of 55 precision bits that can be used for any work needs and good quality sturdy material. This main unit has the ability to recharge it and use it with the electricity to have easy functionality. This screwdriver has led lights in the top of the device and it helps to clearly visualize the work area. Since the main unit has magnet on the top of the unit it is easy to attract screwdriver head over it. Because all are made up of sturdy metal this set can be used for any occasion. This comes with a handy carrying case and its very versatile to use in any location and I keep this item in my car trunk. Overall I am really happy about this.,"July 2, 2020",K.G
Just what is needed for electronic repairs,5.0,Just received the set and have already used it to replace a broken screen in a laptop.  When you have the right tools it makes the job so much easier to accomplish.  Have never replaced a laptop screen before but 15 minutes later the laptop is good as new. The magnetic bits make dealing with tiny screws a breeze.  No more dropping the screw and never being able to retrieve it or even find it.  The handle makes removing and reinserting these tiny screws simple.  The included magnetic screw memory map helps you to organize the tiny screws you removed and insures that they go back into their proper hole. Can't comment on the longevity of the kit but so far I am very impressed.,"September 12, 2020",tzcnd
Not precise,2.0,"While this kit has many bits, they are not all perfectly fit in the driver. Some are hard to push in and pull out, some are flimsy. Some bits do not precisely fit in the screw's head either. The chromium coating is of poor quality and I'll update this review once I'll do a load test. The organizer box is a bit of stupid design. It it has two lids on opposite sides. While all the bits are in one side of the box, the screw driver and other tools are in the opposite. So, you'd better to get tools ready before you start looking for a bit. This set has many rear bits and I'll keep it just for this reason. Otherwise, it would go back to seller.","July 3, 2020",Brian Sonntag
"Very high quality, indeed....",5.0,"I'm rather pleased with this purchase, from the driver to the bits and right down to the casing. I've had about a dozen of these so-called precision driver kits, I've brought another kit along with this one from another vendor, seriously. But by far this is the one that speak volumes on quality. I'm very critical of what I brought with my hard-earned money hence why I've a dozen kits, but 5 Stars it is.... I'm still looking forward to using this kit, I've so many....","February 14, 2019",M5CS
Simple,5.0,"This is a very nice tool that feels good in the hand as well. The aluminum case and all the bits seems to be strong enough.  I do put my set inside my toolbox so it does scratch from all the other tools i have in there but that's not an issue. Durability wise I think the bits will last very long for me. I do not frequently use this, however, the hinge where you release the bits from the case seems to be made from some kind of material that I do not think will last as long as the bits and handle. would recommend this to anyone looking for a full bit set.","August 3, 2019",b1ack1otus
Sad to Have to Return It: Received Defect,3.0,"For this price, the precision screwdrivers are actually pretty decent. The materials are alright enough for this price, and the materials for the bits aren't the kind that would strip either. It's compact and simple, but the tray would occasionally pop out. Forced to Return: I would love to keep this, but my screwdriver set was essentially saturated with grease/chemical on the tray along with a pungent chemical smell. Upon contacting the seller, they were kind enough to offer me a 20% discount and apologized for the defect. I tried to clean up the chemical but it wasn't too effective, so I ended up having to return the set.","January 12, 2020",Emily L
"Absolutely Fantastic for the occasional DIYer, but probably garbage to a Pro.",4.0,"The bits seem to have fairly good tolerances, with a very positive lock from bit into screw on the Tx5.  The driver could use a little bit of work, as rotating the driver shows a significant wobble in the driver itself.  Having said that, most of this precision work is done at very low speeds so it's not really very significant to me, the bits are more important.  This is my only super-precision set, so my needs are quite modest, but with the huge selection of bits I imagine this will be my go-to for delicate work for a long while.  If you use these tools daily, this kit will probably drive you nuts.  For me as an only occasional user, it will probably last me a lifetime and be a life-saver every (infrequent) time it's required.","August 24, 2020",Michael Wood
Quality Set,5.0,"My go-to set. I love to tinker and this is the set I bring with me when I need to fix anything. Pros: - Fast - it was delivered quickly. - Value - best bang for your buck. - Heavy & Durable - a quality set. - Organized - easy to find bits, stays in place. - Compact - double sided, easy to carry. - Magnetic - easy to pick up small bits. - Bits - a variety of quality bits in this set - Comfortable - rotating cap helps do the job comfortably did not realize how great the rotating cap is until now. - Case - simple and clean looking. The two part clicks together. Cons: - Case - the clicking works well to keep it together however if you shake it hard enough it tends to slide out but no biggie. - Wished the symbols were engraved cause I thought they would wear off overtime but they haven’t after a year so all is good. Also had a quick question and they were quick to reply. Great customer service. (Update) Overall: I would recommend buying this mini precision screwdriver set if you want a sleek  affordable set to repair your everyday items.","June 18, 2019",Jooliee
All about magnets,5.0,I love that this screwdriver set has all of the bits magnetically attached to the case as well as magnetically lock into the driver itself. Also the locking mechanism is really good as my previous tool sets have the lid lock broken. The only issue I have is that the bits doesn't have a lot of magnetic strength to hold a screw on the tip. But it may be just my screws. Overall solid built product,"January 16, 2019",Maximus
UN KIT QUI PEUX VOUS SAUVER DES $$$$$,5.0,"De nos jours, faire réparer un appareil électronique en boutique, juste parce qu'il vous manque les outils, peut vous coûter plus cher que l'appareil lui-même.

Great Value!,5.0,"Having had a 66 piece precision set but not completely satisfied with it, I wanted to pick up a new set with more bits.  This set was a great price and offered far more bits than my previous set.  The bits are easily removed from the case for use, unlike my previous set which required using needle nose pliers in order to get the bit out of the case. The quality also seems to be great and should last for a very long time.  I cannot speak to the other accessories as I have not used them yet, but the screwdriver and bits are worth the price for them alone.","September 27, 2020",Amazon Customer
"Impressive collection of drivers in a durable, compact case",5.0,"Overall, compared to the chincey driver sets that come in plastic cases that always break, this is an awesome deal! Metal case is compact. Beware if shaken while open, driver bits will drop. Aside from that, the bits seem robust and the selection is a HUGE. Fit and finish seems excellent I’m pretty picky about my tools/instruments so despite the low price, was “WOWED”","January 31, 2020",Dr. Roger S. Harrington
Absolutely loved this product!,5.0,It is definitely not the greatest quality but it does what its supposed to do! For the price I am extremely pleased with what I got. If you plan on using these tools for heavy duty there's a chance something might break so think about investing in a more solid set. In my case I only needed these for my Arduino build which are small electronic devises so this set worked like a charm.,"September 17, 2020",Jordan Alba
Great quality would recommend,5.0,"Had so many extra pieces compared to most sets for this price, would highly recommend. The screw driver itself is decent, the options and extensions are amazing! The plastic part on top feels a bit cheap and is hard to spin sometimes. The grey plastic parts in the case that you use to pry open things seem to break a little easily but I’m not very gentle either.","August 26, 2020",Orle
I just wish the bits were more durable,4.0,"This feels study and well-built, but I've had a couple of the bits strip out on some light disassembly tasks already. In my opinion, a Torx bit should not ever strip out on you unless you're using the wrong size or excessive force. Still, I like the case, and I like the driver. I'm sure I can find replacement bits that will last longer.","July 5, 2020",Olive
Great mini screwdriver set. You can't go wrong.,5.0,"I needed a mini screwdriver set for my family's electronic devices and for my kids' toys. This is set is perfect for my needs. It is small, well organized and very user friendly. The screwdriver bits are magnetically attached to the carrying case which is solid and compact. It is very handy and can easily and conveniently be carried with you in a jacket pocket or backpack. Having 48 different bits or heads is nice. I would buy this again.","January 14, 2019",S.M.
Comprehensive set of screws,5.0,"This is a great screwdriver set for a lot of different uses. The interchangeable bits are easy to switch, held in place with small magnets, and are sturdy when in use. The case is very durable and is very portable. I've even been able to use them to screw the small screws on a pair of glasses. I would highly recommend this screwdriver set!","June 22, 2020",George Y
Great set,5.0,Very well made. Case is push to lock/unlock so the kit will stay together. Also the case shell is metal. I think aluminum as it is non-magnetic. Bits are magnetized and are magnetically held in place so you do not have to struggle to un-clip a bit which is a problem with most other sets. Bits look well made of hardened steel. Definitely recommend this set!,"February 25, 2019",Dennis S
Incredibly soft material,2.0,"The bit to the left was used for laptop screws and it's been twisted out of shape (you can see the vanes are curved). The phillips was wearing out really quick on wood screws, which shouldn't be so tough on the bit... Really low quality. The magnets on some bits also weakened so I can't turn the kit over without some falling to the ground. Overall, the experience quickly goes downhill","May 21, 2020",Gavin
You get what you pay for,3.0,"For the price and the amount of versatility of screws and combination it is amazing. The screws are nicely organized which i very much appreciate but for the life of me i cannot get the screws to properly insert in the screwdriver. I have just accepted that it does not fit at all. The only time it does fit is in the bendable extender that comes with it. The tips do not have a very strong magnet, it barely picks up the nuts and bolts you unscrew.","April 25, 2020",Sabrina
Great Hobbyist Set with tons of bits/sizes !!,5.0,Amazing little kit - a must have to repair any small items - Allen Torx Philips Flat - great little telescoping driver w/extensions etc. + CHEAP $$ -1 star due to cheap plastic handle and chrome type material of bits looks cheap and chippable coating in the future - not the top quality for everyday use - but perfect for any hobbyist,"April 7, 2020",brbo
Premium feels,5.0,"It contains all screwdriver bits that I need for DIY laptop repairing.

This thing is a beast,5.0,"Got this for my dad after I finally got tired of his old sets (missing various heads of all sizes and shapes).

The metal quality seems very solid and I think this can easily last my dad many years to come (provided he doesn't lose it)","January 31, 2020",Jim
Good design but single use material.,1.0,"This kit is a single use tool. Used it to fix 1 gadget and the tips got worn out immediately. It's too bad, this tool's design is very neat with great features. If the manufacturer would invest in standard grade materials I would make an amazing product.","November 7, 2020",Bruce
Great precision screwdriver set,5.0,"If you’re working on electronics, this set should have every bit you need to get into every device you have, from proprietary Apple screws to tri-wing and other unusual tips.  Nice having some extra components too like plastic spudgers to help open tight enclosures and such.","February 25, 2020",D. Griffiths
Good in a pinch but not great quality,3.0,"Basic bits will do their job, but for example, security bits are almost useless. I could barely get the screws off on a German-made piece of equipment. The spudger is made out of very soft plastic, so it may last you a single phone repair, but nothing beyond that. The bit-holder is decent for the money, though.","December 1, 2019",Moonrunner
48 is amazing.,5.0,Literally has all of the screwdrivers you need in there. Enough said. The magnetic function is great because sometimes you drop the screw in a very deep place and it's hard for you to get it with your bare hands. Very sweet function. The case is built very well. I love how you have to pressure pop the top in order to open the case. The screwdrivers themselves have excellent quality. 5/5 would buy again.,"January 12, 2019",Cyrus T.
Best option considering value for money,5.0,"This set is surprising considering the price. The quality of the screwdriver, tips and the aluminum case is excellent. The indication of the format and the shape is engraved on each bits which makes it possible to keep the whole organized if one uses several pieces at the same time. The only negative is in the plastic ends that serve as a locking mechanism, I doubt their durability. Cet ensemble est surprenant considérant le prix. La qualité du tournevis, des embouts et de l'étui en aluminium est excellente. L'indication du format et de la forme est gravée sur chaque embout ce qui permet de garder l'ensemble organisé si on utilise plusieurs pièces à la fois. Le seul point négatif se trouve dans les extrémités en plastique qui servent de mécanisme de verrouillage, je doute de leur durabilité.","April 30, 2019",Simple Customer
"Very happy, works great on Macbook Pro.",5.0,"After spending lots of money on cheapos and expensive sets, I think this is the one. It's magnetic, it has and excellent storage case and layout, cool and practical design. I have already used the pentalobe and torx 1 to open the infamous macbook pro. Pulled screws without a glitch, even a couple that seems to have been over tightened. Very pleased, highly recommended.","March 14, 2019",Mihail A. Popa
Good set for the money,5.0,"Awesome set and just what I needed for electronics. Quality is great, the screwdriver feels perfect and the case is sleek and easy to use. Tips are held in magnetically, so don't drop the holder once it's out of the case as the tips will all fall out.","April 12, 2020",Vincent Adultman
Decent little tool kit,3.0,"Okay overall product. Some of the heads have already stripped, but I'm not really using them as intended on small phone or computer parts, so it may just be my fault. Overall value is really good and I am happy with the product. Price was cheap, so worth it.","October 31, 2020",C. P.
Lots of variety of bits,5.0,"I’ve been looking for a precision screwdriver set for awhile and needed one that had most of the bits I needed.  This kit has every bit you could possibly need. If you’re someone who constantly takes things apart or makes repairs, this kit pays for itself.","March 15, 2020",S
A definite must-have for tinkerers who repair their own small electronics,5.0,"It's a nice, compact, handsome little carrying case that takes up about as much space as a TV remote, yet has just about every bit size you could ever need to take anything apart for repairs. It has a bit for pretty much everything, with the only exception being the bits used by old NES consoles. I've found myself using the hex bits in it more than anything else since I utterly despise allen keys.","September 5, 2020",Tyler Garvey
Good product for the cheap price.,4.0,"It comes with everything it said giving you a variety of tools you may not have. The whole reason I bought this product was for the three/tri point head however, after viewing the other bits in person I noticed a number of bits I could use that I've only seen once or twice in my household. Obviously this is a budget kit and you not going to get the same quality that you would from a $60-$100 but it gets the job done for the low price point. Overall would recommend especially if this a just convenient purchase without breaking your bank.","September 24, 2020",Daniel
Decent product but...,4.0,It arrived with the near majority of driver heads fallen out of plastic holders.  I had to sort them all back into place.  I would strongly recommend tightening up mold of driver head base so that they actually stay in place.  You can pull them out with minimal ease... Other than that - good product and decent price.  Arrived on time.,"June 16, 2020",nick podolsky
Very Practical,4.0,"Nice little kit,includes bits I have never seen but at least when you need it its there in that Kit. Seems to be of good quality but its hard to tell until you really neef to use all of those bits.","November 25, 2019",Ssmirage
Magnetic heaven,5.0,"Had everything I needed to repair my laptop! The case is sleek - it's magnetic so nothing can get lost. The place where the driver normally sits can also be used as a magnetic screw tray so nothing rolls around on your desk and gets lost. Additionally, the entire case is slimmer than most phones (with cases), meaning it can easily fit in my back pocket.","January 23, 2019",Eric
They work perfectly,5.0,"I needed to tighten the tiny screws on prescription glasses and sunglasses. With the marking beside each one to show what shape the head sported, it was easy to find the right one. It slipped into the holder perfectly, and did the job just as I wanted it to do. Love it!","August 8, 2019",Glenoran1
It has all what you needed for day to day repair,5.0,"A very complete set. I wanted a screwdriver set that have everything for my day to day repair.

Recommended for everyday small to medium size jobs.","January 9, 2020",Jintal
"Bien, sans plus",3.0,"Je voulais un petit tournevis électrique pour mes différents travaux. Celui-ci est bien, mais pas assez puissant pour mes besoins.

La boîte de rangement est bien aussi.","November 10, 2020",Dave Laurendeau
Great price,4.0,Great price for the amount of screw heads you get. I love that they're slightly magnetic so that they're easy to stick into the little screw handle. The only (minor) issue I have with these is that the metal is on the softer side so you have to be careful with certain screws and aligning them into place. Can't complain a whole lot for 20 bucks though!,"February 21, 2019",Dancinglemur
Great Mini Screwdriver set,5.0,"I needed a mini Torx bit, and this set had the right size. The case is made of aluminum and did not have any logo or branding on it - heard this was a problem with others that had ordered the set. The screwdriver itself is solid, and the bits are all stamped with the size. The holder for the screwdriver & bits has magnets in it, so everything stays in place, and the specific bit type is silkscreened onto it. Great set for the money, and great quality.","May 25, 2020",Amazon Customer
Awesome!,5.0,I've bought a lot of cheap precision screwdrivers in the past and I strip the heads on anything that doesn't turn easily. These will be the last ones I'll ever need. Love the storage case and the way it's spring loaded to open/close. LOTS of bit selections and the magnetic holders in the case stop them from accidently falling out if you tip the open case. I've used it on a tough philips screw and it worked flawlessly. Love it!,"June 29, 2019",Christer Hedman
A must for DIYers,5.0,"This has all the bits that you are likely to need for those small finicky repair jobs. The quality, sizes and types of bits appear to be very good and you should have the right bit for almost any electronics repair/upgrade etc. Recommend.","June 19, 2020",Electraglide02
Tournevis plus que satisfaisant,4.0,"J'ai utilisé se produit plusieurs fois et tout est normal... le tournevis réussit à dévisser des vis serré mécaniquement sans dommage des douilles ou du manche mais les accessoires en plastique son JUSTE une bonne base pour commencer, la finition des outils en plastique est pas très propre, mais ont peux s'en contenter parfaitement si ont en a besoin une ou deux fois par année mais si ces pour une utilisation de démontage régulières il va falloir d'autre outils comme seux en plastique plus ""professionnelle"" comme des ifixit","January 27, 2020",caever
Really well made,5.0,I was very impressed with the quality of the product. The screwdriver and the bits look very precise and the case is super slick and functional.

Stopped Working but.......,5.0,"Was enjoying the product but stopped working last week (bought late April 2018).  It will not erase the screen.  I have replaced the battery numerous times.  I have contacted the manufacturer and hope to work something out as it still under warranty. UPDATE: So I contacted them and within an hour or so they responded and arranged a new one for me.  Incredible service, very impressive.","September 11, 2018",P. G.
"Very Useful, Thin & Lightweight!!!!",5.0,My wife and I love this tablet and it's making our lives so much easier. I often get notes from my wife on what to do or pick up and me being me I usually loose them..... Not on purpose ;-). With this I'm not worried about loosing notes again and I also don't have to run around anymore trying to find a pen and paper to take a quick note. I gave it to my toddler to draw but he lost interest fairly easily since it's not a car he won't really play with anything that's not a car for now. You can see the writing very clearly without any problems and it's also very thin and light which gives it a nice clean look. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for  a reusable note taking or if you have a child that loves to draw. This will save you money on paper and pens!!!!,"March 5, 2018",gabriel j. banc
It is cheap looking/ feeling but does exactly what is says,5.0,"When it arrived I though it was very cheap looking and not worth the $16 I paid for it. It does what it says though and everything is as shown , just expect a light piece of plastic. The pen doesnt hold in the slot and falls out most of the time. But it serves it purpose and we pay just as much for a silly surprise toy so I still prefer to give the kiddo something which is more ""educational"". This is a good way to make writing fun for kids, especially those in JK who can associate learning with fun. Pretty sure this can be beat up a bit also. I purchased for a 4.5 year old.","March 18, 2020",Monica S.
LOVE IT REALLY HANDY,5.0,"I bought a smaller pad as gift, then I found I need one myself. So I got this bigger and bright green version. The color is exactly same as picture. It’s super convenient for me to write down any note , especially the shopping list. This actually works really well. Smith and clear. It had a lock that prevents work from being erased when you press the middle button, but if you want it erasable, you just unlock it and the button works to easily erase everything","March 2, 2020",Arin Iglesias
Simple and Awesome,5.0,I bought 2 of these. One for myself and one for my son. First off I love it. It's simple and easy to use. I have mine on my desk for jotting notes. I have reduce my paper consumption significantly since buying it. My son loves his. He brings it to school for doodles on his lunch break since he likes to draw. I strongly recommend this for anyone with kids or just to reduce paper consumption!,"March 11, 2020",BG
Replacement of Sticky Notes,5.0,"This pad is very good because it replaces my sticky notes. Many times I only wrote down one item on it and dispose after few minutes after I finished the information. Now I can just press a button and it'll be erased! I also enjoy the lock button which can lock the data written on there to avoid accidentally deleting info. The button is at the top, but I use it at the bottom like a tablet.","December 15, 2019",Daniel C
I use this at work,5.0,"I use this at work as the weather is not that reliable . I take the info I need then I transfer it to the proper form in the office,I save a lot of paper and I do not damage the form.It is so light that after a while you do not notice you have it.When I retire I will put it on the fridge for notes.","September 12, 2020",Tom & Monika McMahon
"Fun, but could be brighter.",4.0,I would have given it a 5 if it was Brighter. The colors on it are very dark and dimmed for me unless I have it under direct light like a desk lamp or the sun. It's really easy to use and fun to draw and doodle on and erase right away. But you can't fix your mistakes in a long etched drawing. It's basically an Etch a Sketch with a stylus.,"March 7, 2018",Dante Fadelle
Ok,3.0,It seems like a really good idea and then it’s like our tablets and iPads already have apps that you can do this thing on you just need a stylus and so I was thinking that it’s a little bit wasteful to have one of these so it’s not worth it.,"October 5, 2020",Dani
Love it and especially love the stretchy cord!,5.0,"I purchased this for my son. My daughter has the ""named brand"", which was double the price. After using it, my daughter wishes she has this one instead! The colours are vibrant and they liked that it had a lock feature. My favorite part is the optional stretchy string that comes with it! Everytime my son borrowed my daughter's, he would misplace her pen. We don't have that worry with the string!","March 3, 2020",Alicia M
Very useful.,5.0,"As someone that uses a lot of post-it notes to write down stuff, this is very useful. There are 3 colors (the text changes color as you write down the screen), and a lock button so you don't accidentally delete what you have written down. I'll be buying a second one.","February 23, 2020",VP

Great buy,4.0,"As expected. It's thin and lightweight. A great alternative to the more expensive options out there. I do wish it was a bit brighter, but writing more slowly helps make the lines thicker.

This is better than a tablet,5.0,"Definitely a great gift for any kid. If you don’t want them using tablets or iPads but can’t find something to replace their needs with. This is definitely the one. It’s colourful and perfect size for their small hands. It’s also lightweight and clean. So after their done writing or drawing, with a touch of a button, everything gets erased.","March 11, 2020",Mona
Good purchase,4.0,"This review will be a little premature as I gave this to my little granddaughter only today.  She absolutely loves it.  Hopefully it works for a long time and she gets lots of good use out of it.  I removed a star only because, especially for little hands, it's too easy to lose the stylus.  In our case dropped on the outside deck floor and fell between the slats (no man's land -- no one wants to crawl on their belly under the deck to try to find it in the spider-infested dark).  I think it would be a great solution to attach the stylus to the drawing tablet with a cord.  This would prevent the loss of the stylus.  I'm trying to find something inexpensive to replace the stylus but so far am not having much success.","August 28, 2020",Amazon Customer
"Very Easy to Use, Perfect for kids",5.0,"This writing tablet is much better than using a classic pen board, The ease of use is aw3esome, you just scribble and press the button and it goes away. Also, there is a locking button to keep stuff written from getting accidentally wiped which helps a lot with little ones. My daughter is using this for drawing and scribbling and she loves it. They have also included a second battery in the box which is very convenient since you won't spend two days looking for a button battery when it will run out.","August 13, 2020",Mohamed Berrachdi
LCD writing tablet,5.0,comes nicely packaged with protective pouch (would make a great gift for children). Includes extra battery and instruction sheet. It is lightweight and easy for my children to hold onto. The lock button is handy if you want to save a picture from being accidentally erased. The button at the bottom quickly erases any drawings or messages with a simple press. The pen writes smoothly. Great for road trips and camping to keep my children entertained without the use of electronics,"May 22, 2020",Nicole B
A boy's birthday present,5.0,"Today is my good friend's son's birthday. Although there is no party. But I promised the little guy a present. Take it to his house this morning and leave. In the afternoon, his mother called me and said he liked it. Because he likes drawing very much. He is running out of paper for drawing. She was going out to buy paper for her son. Now she doesn't need the picture board I sent.","May 14, 2020",Bindy
Couldn't use it,1.0,"The place to put batteries didn't unscrew, it was broken so my daughter could not use the product as intended. I did contact the seller to see if he could fix it, and didn't offer any solutions - so I will have to return this tablet.","April 21, 2020",MrsBerry
Total simplicity of operation makes it perfect for toddlers.,5.0,My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves this thing.

Excellent,5.0,"Really nice, good quality easy assembly.","December 25, 2019",Orlando Esteves
"Great chair, super comfy for long gaming sessions",5.0,"Great gaming chair, other people in my home have Cougar gaming chairs and I can say this one is more comfortable, more cushion on the base where you sit on. Great chair, easy to assemble, decent quality, love the blue color design. Shipping was a bit late, but I can mention this was ordered right before COVID-19 caused amazon shipping delays. Unlike some gaming chair this one's armrest do not rotate but its not a necessary feature, very comfy and ergonomic armrest for long gaming sessions, I play 8-10+ hours often.","May 22, 2020",Jean-François Tremblay
The back support of chair is not same which was shown when I ordered it.,4.0,"I ordered the chair it is different from which I ordered, the armrest were attach to back support and seat has curves from side. Looks like the chair is same company but different versions. Thought it’s fine. I don’t want to be in trouble of replacing it.","May 15, 2020",Lalit
"Good value for money, but don't expect the equivalent of a $500 chair.",4.0,"After working from home for an extended period of time due to the pandemic, I decided my budget computer chair wasn't cutting it fir an 8 hour workday. I also didn't want to spend $500+ for a brand name ergo or gaming chair. This is the perfect middle ground. The chair is comfortable to sit in, fairly adjustable (except arm heights) and at half the price of high end chairs. I no longer get lower back pain at the end of the workday. CONS: Fairly easy to assemble but the instructions could be a bit clearer. The footrest option is a nice touch but it doesn't feel like it's firmly attached to the chair which makes me hesitate to rest the weight of my legs on it.","June 14, 2020",Jacques
comfort and durability.,4.0,nothing,"January 26, 2020",Dennis Robins
Barely ok,3.0,"I like the width of the chair and how it looks. What I DON’T like Is the arm rests are very loose. Poor design. The chair is ok enough that I won’t return it, but I expected better.","July 19, 2020",Nunyobusiness
The material is Great quality,4.0,Incredible quality .. just the arm supports don’t tighten up so the wiggle.. how can I fix this?,"June 6, 2020",E & B
"Great chair for the price with all the features, instructions could use some work",4.0,"honestly for the lightning deal of $150 CAD the chair is great quality,pretty  comfortable and has more features then others at this price range, finding chairs with padded arm rests is already pretty hard regardless of price, so the fact you get firm memory foam arm rests(covered in a smooth leather) , adjustable/retractable leg rest and  neck /lumbar support pillows is crazy for the price, with all the good comes some bad, i have seen people on here with slightly damaged arm rests, and one person had a rip in the leather  aswell i seen that someone else's arm rest had completely snapped off , this wasn't the case for me, it was on time and came in basically perfect condition (that said i have only had this chair for about 1-2 weeks now, i will update this review if anything happens) my main gripe is the instructions, they are 3 pages long, with about 5 steps, its usable but sorta confusing. i'll give it 4 stars due to the instructions, and the fact some others here have had a few issues i like the chair and it goes very well with my set up, try to snag on lightning deal if possible as for $150 you can't go wrong with this. though even at full price of $200-$210 its still a good deal since it has the features many chairs skimp out at this price range. A clear recommendation from me.","October 6, 2020",Xmodsthespot
"Great chair, terrible arm rests",3.0,If you’re looking for an affordable gaming chair. This might be the product for you. It was great overall but I found the armrests extremely uncomfortable while gaming on mouse and keyboard as they were way too high and I was forced to lift my shoulders up which is terrible for my neck and back. I saw another chair under the same company with adjustable arm rests which I highly recommend over this one,"August 3, 2020",Joshua
Chaise correcte,2.0,J’utilise cette chaise pour le travail! Somme toute la chaises est correcte! Le blocage pour le balancement s’enleve toujours !

Not bad for price,4.0,The cushion by your head the elastic that holds it in place was not sewn right and tore when assembling,"September 28, 2020",Marshall
All good except the one wiggly arm rest,4.0,One of the arms was not very “stable”. That said did not need any arms for intended set up. Would have preferred a no arm version without two fasteners having to stick out if one chooses not to put arms on the chair.,"August 8, 2020",Mike
Comfy chair for chilling,3.0,"I like the foot rest, pillows add comfort. It was a little bit tough to assemble (required two people). it's great if you're watching shows off Netflix if you're sitting at your desk. I mostly use it for home schooling.","October 5, 2020",Jyra

Fall weather accessory that every teen needs,5.0,"It's hard to get our teens to wear a hat (it's just not cool/messes their hair, etc).  Since they always have their music on, I thought this might be something they'd consider, and I was right. Son loves it.  Hat is thin (not a -40 hat, but perfect for those 0 degrees mornings), soft and it covers his head and ears.  The sound is decent too, and the charge lasts him a couple of days.  This hat's a win!","October 25, 2020",Gary Lavoie

He loves the bluetooth features and uses it even in the 100+ degree weather here in California. Only thing that was a bit confusing is the plus and minus signs is used to skip a song or video, not for volume. The volume is controlled by your phone. Other than that the distance works as described, it's very well made, soft material and works great!","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2019",Alicia Denney

Compared to the Boogie Board,4.0,"We are homeschoolers and use the (name brand) Boogie Board nearly daily for math or just for playing. We've had ours for over a year and it's in rough shape with some scratches on the screen making it a bit of a mess to write on. I ordered two of these so each of my kids had one, but also so we had a spare. Pros: Size - We bought the 10"" and both kids were excited at the extra doodling space Price - I do think with some shopping around I could have gotten cheaper, but with the reviews and cost, it seemed like the least risk for the best price. Battery - They each came with an extra battery, which I appreciate because it's not the kind we usually have on hand. The pen - *Really* snaps in there. It's basically guaranteed to not fall out unintentionally. Cons: Strength -  Without a case, I wouldn't give this one to children under 4. It's not as tough as the Boogie Board, but is still decent if your kids will not be dropping it a lot or storing it under their toys. I'm regretting not buying one with a case. Brightness - While it's not as bright as the Boogie Board, it's still fine. No complaints but is noticeable. The Pen - Didn't come with a string to connect it to the board, which would be fine, but the ""pro"" of it really snapping in, means it kind of flings out when you push it out. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I expect it to meet our needs as my kids are 6 and 8 and will be more gentle. I love having LCD boards on hand to save paper and for quick scratch work.","April 30, 2020",Christine
Highly recommended for home schooling..,5.0,"I bought it for my son as we are doing home schooling. He always use to run behind my note but since I bought this for him, he is very happy and always kept himself busy in writing and drawing different things. The size of the tablet is very good that gives extra space to write and draw. It comes with an extra battery that is very good as it is not the one that we usually always have at home. It is very easy to use and gives feeling that you are writing on chalk board without any mess. The best part is that it is not an electronic tablet and there is no fear of radiations that is usually not good for anyone but specially for kids.","July 17, 2020",Umair
Ideal for kids learning to write. No radiations or back lighting.,5.0,"This LCD Electronic tablet is a great gift for my kid. She just started to learn writing and she really enjoys these tablet. This dry erase works very well and it erases  quickly with one button. The pad is good for my kid to improve the handwriting and she keeps over writing to learn new words. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and didn't had any battery life issues. One of the reason for buying this, as it mentioned that it is radiation free and no back light as they are bad for small kids. This tablet pad has super low energy consumption and does not require any charging. It can be used on fridge to take notes, We don't  use it on the fridge though. It comes with a magnet which can be applied on to back to stick it to metal surfaces. Overall this product is easy to use and great for kids learning to write.","July 14, 2020",Jasmine
Great gift.,5.0,"My daughter(4) is loving this little thing and I love that it gets her off of the tablet. It isn’t as bright as I’d expected like in the area where she colours, but she doesn’t seem to mind at all. She tells me she is busy working and writes away lol. Nice to have a somewhat green way of practising our pre printing skills. She didn’t touch her tablet last night and this morning went right for this board instead, hurray!","June 18, 2020",Kristina MacDonald

Great functionality for scribbling and doodling,5.0,"This actually works really well. It had a lock that prevents work from being erased when you press the middle button, but if you want it erasable, you just unlock it and the button works to easily erase everything.

,,"I got this for my wife who creates a to-do list for me almost everyday. This saves us a lot of note paper. I like it's size, not too big, not too small, and it can't blow away or easily get lost or mistakingly thrown away like a small piece of paper can. It's very simple to use with a locking switch to make sure nothing is accidentally erased.","Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020",Eli S.
,,"We got this little drawing pad for my two year old, who is very hard to entertain. It was very easy to use, there is one button to erase and then you just stary over again.. She absolutely loved this, it was also a family affair because she wanted both my husband and I involved in her drawing. Which any toys that do that is an A+ in my book. I would definitely recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2020",Jessica Anhalt
,,The size was wonderful and the lock feature was great too but the drawings did not show up well (barely could see them.)  It also said it had different colors and the one we received only had one color.

Everything included,5.0,"Awesome picture quality, i upgraded my old digital frame who has a lot of pixel and this one is much better. It came with a microsd card 32gb with sd adaptor, so no need to buy one separately. It is not to big and not too small, just perfect size for bedroom desk. Hour and calendar function are great with small picture slideshow next to it. Remote work well too and power cable is long enough to reach power outlet easily. The frame feel solid and is of good quality.","August 1, 2019",Erickos
Crisp and clear screen and good all around performer,5.0,"We were on the hunt for a small, discreet digital photo frame with a IPS high definition screen that didn't break the bank. We also specifically didn't want any branding or designs other than mimicking a traditional photo frame. We originally looked at ones at our local london drugs and best buy and what not, but most of them were either more expensive or just didn't seem to be made well. This so far has checked all those boxes. The build quality feels solid and not economical, and most importantly the screen is rich and vibrant. The viewing angle is wide as we can view it from the sides and it doesn't deviate much. Thus far it has had no issues playing a plethora of formats that've we've put in from photos (we've put in 4 different formats) to music to video (have tried 5 formats). The auto rotate has worked on cue, you would think it's a easy function but some of the previous units we got somehow failed at it. We have it on the desk using the horizontal stand but there are mounting holes if we choose to move it to the wall. There's a remote control included, whether or not we have use for it, but the 32gb micro sd card that come with it sure is a nice bonus. All in all a affordable and well made unit with very good clarity in screen performance. Ps. if you're wondering if it can serve as a standalone movie player - yes it can actually, since it plays video files and outputs sound.","August 16, 2019",SWINCAN
Amazing to watch past Memories,5.0,I got this photo Frame colour is really nice. I downloaded my last 10 years photos and videos now I am enjoying it each day or else no time to see old photos now I can watch that and enjoyed my past dates. I can controls with remote to change the Photos and videos and also use the calendar with our photos best thing is got with Microsd card . Also use the USB drive to use the photos. Screen quality is good and has voice to watch the video with sound .,"January 15, 2020",Pari
Consistently Defective Product.,1.0,"I purchased one of these in the beginning of 2020, only to find that it would constantly freeze. Next, I reformatted all my JPEGs, which are the only file-type I ever tried to display as the slideshow. I reformatted them not to be larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Again, that picture frame started freezing. Next, near the end of 2020, I purchased a second frame, belonging to a new batch, which this review is about, hoping that my first one was merely a coincidental defect. But now, the second picture frame has also started freezing, 1 day after my having received it. I am not happy. Dirk","January 15, 2020",Dirk Mittler
Great quality and all included,5.0,"Wanted to free up some storage on my phone while still retaining the memories in some form and my friend recommended this to me. I would like to say that I was really shocked with how good of quality the pictures are on the screen. The device is slim and crisp looking and blends in well on my coffee table in my living room. It comes with a stand and remote and the cable which is long enough to reach a good distance. I really enjoy how it’s a media player as well with the music and slideshow options. You can decide how many pictures you want per screen and it self rotated and pictures which was what attracted me most. This digital photo frame does it all and it even comes with an SD card which was an added bonus. For the price and what you receive, I am beyond happy with it. Would be a great personal gift item to a loved one this coming holiday season!","November 5, 2019",Noah S
Frame is nice but FREEZES CONSTANTLY,1.0,I purchased two of these frames and while they look very sharp and the display is great they FREEZE CONSTANTLY!!! I've tried adjusting the resolution of the pictures but no matter what they BOTH freeze up after several hours. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a picture frame to display various pictures if it freezes up all the time! There is no way to contact the seller and there is no web page to go to for downloading a firmware update. Very disappointed. If the seller can solve this problem I will revise my review but otherwise it will stand at a disappointing 1 star review even though it could be so much better.,"September 25, 2020",ThatGuy
"Clear image, not clear instructions",4.0,"The picture quality is great (10 inch model) and it’s a nice device, but the user manual is deficient, the operation non- intuitive, and there are many unanswered questions. How to go back from a sub menu? Does it support cable transfer to the memory card? Why does it sometimes play the same don’t twice on random? Why does it always start with the same picture/song when it’s in random? Other than these usability issues and the non-intuitive interface it’s a really nice product.","August 19, 2019",JSMtl
Great memories with a digital album,4.0,"Good digital frame, I wanted to put all of my babies photos in an album but then I came across this digital album and I thought it was pretty cool to just have all the pics on slideshow so I can watch it all the time instead taking time out and going through the album. It was kind of hard to upload photos since they are on my Icloud so then I had to find a laptop that can read the SD card and upload the pics. It's pretty straightforward to use. You can also just use an iPad but this album would always just stay on. I think it is a bit pricey but is a pretty good digital album. I would have preferred if pics can be downloaded to the album through wifi or something that is more used now.","January 31, 2020",Sabeen
Excellente qualité,5.0,"La qualité d'image est meilleure que notre ancien cadre photo, (je suis vraiment impressionnée) peut lire de la musique, des vidéos et des photos.  Cela fonctionne très bien. Tout ce que j'ai fait, c'est mettre une carte SD, on peut aussi mettre une USB puis les images commencent à tourner. J'aime sa variété d'options Vous pouvez mettre vos photos au hasard ou dans un ordre, aussi ajuster la durée pendant laquelle vous souhaitez voir la photo de 3 secondes à 1 heure. Il est livré avec une télécommande: facile à utiliser et fonctionne parfaitement. Je suis satisfait de mon achat et je trouve qu'il vaut bien la valeur de mon argent. Je le recommanderai assurément.","November 2, 2020",Fanny
Great as a gift,5.0,"I got this digital frame as an e-frame to display my family portraits in the family room. It is also suitable for as a gift, the way it’s packaged. Retains and display the quality of my pictures and does not distort images. Perfect addition to any coffee table in family room as a dynamic photo frame. This does not have any inbuilt memory and nor did it come with SD card. So purchase of storage card/USB is required (extra cost).","September 27, 2020",SD
It plays movies and music too!,5.0,"This picture frame  has a remote control thats super helpful. It Looks like a tv screen, it's nice and bright and sharp. I tested it to plays mp3s , waves music files, mp4 and avi video files. Play movies on the go camping via powerbank . It has everything except wireless streaming,  but for the price I'm happy. It has controls on the back of the frame and can be powered by a usb bank as well as power outlet.","October 4, 2020",UnboxingArmy
Bon rapport qualité/prix,4.0,"Bon rapport qualité prix. Très facile à paramétrer et à faire fonctionner! L’écran de 10’’ est parfait pour utiliser le cadre sur un meuble. Peut-être un peu petit si le but est de le fixer au mur. J’ai trouvé que la transition entre chaque photo n’est pas de très bonne qualité. Aussi, le temps entre chaque photo n’est pas constant. Si on sélectionne 15 secondes d’affichage pour chaque photo, parfois c’est 15 secondes, parfois 30 secondes. Donc certaines photos vont rester affichées plus longtemps que d’autres. Si le temps d’affichage est plus long, exemple 15min pour chaque photo, je suppose que la différence n’est plus si importante. Somme toute, très bon achat et parfait pour offrir en cadeau !","January 2, 2020",Amazon Customer
Freezes and issues with simple images,2.0,"Using it just for simple JPEGs, the frame would freeze multiple times per day and would need to be unplugged to be reset. For some reason images would fail to load fairly regularly and the frame would just display a black screen for 15 seconds before moving on to another photo. We tried using other memory cards and the flaky operation and regular freezing continued. I returned the frame and will be ordering a different one from someone else. The photo quality and size for the 15"" frame were nice, but its not worth the $200 pricetag for the persistent issues","January 26, 2020",Adrian E Milford
Make your memories wonderful,5.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Superb quality product, screen resolution is too good so colors of the photos look like natural. The software part works smoothly and easy to operate. Just connect your usb or sd card and you can play photos or videos.  It can be scheduled start or stop time.  Remote has good coverage simple to use. For the looks i would say its attractive.","September 22, 2020",J Goswami
DOES NOT ROTATE --PORTRAIT AND LANDSCAPE LIKE ITS SUPPOSE TO,1.0,"Returning,,,,,does not auto rotate to portrait mode,, only works in landscape mode. the video instructions on the display clearly say it should rotate.,also it has volume buttons,, but Yhe left and right arrow keep messing up the volume instead of doing their function","November 15, 2019",pat
This item does not work at all,1.0,"The customer service is NON existent, even though the card with the product says, Dear Amazon valued customer. I asked a question about photos and they sent me a long response about VIDEO set up. There is no trouble-shooting information anywhere. It does not recognize the SD card, or anything else I put in. It freezes on the first photo and stays there, even after a factory reset. I made all the files small, they are what is recommended. This was a gift I will have to return. And I will not get another to replace it. Do NOT purchase Kenou.","January 1, 2020",David Moscovitch
Bad programming.,1.0,"Don't buy it.  Random pictures isn't so random.  Same set of pictures show up.  It doesn't matter if it's random or sequence.  Same pictures.  Also, certain pictures, for some reason, are sideways.  If you are running a sequence of pics and you want to go into menu, when you come out of menu, you start at the beginning all over again.  I have a lot of pics and I'll never see the ones towards the end.","January 19, 2020",patrick
Great quality photo frame,5.0,"Very nice photo frame It was well presented in the package, feels sturdy and not cheaply made. Comes with an SD card which is a nice bonus!! It is very multifunctional, from watching movies, to listening to music and having music play while it flicks through your pics!! Very happy with this buy and gives my wife and I a chance to see all our photos, rather than them being stored on our phones and laptops","August 12, 2019",Prospect Projects
Perfect size,5.0,"Very impressed with this photo frame I'm excited to give it to my father in law as a gift. He is always taking pictures and then never knows what to do with them. Size is amazing it's big but not crazy to look like a small TV. Comes with all the pieces and a memory card. You can either hang it like a normal picture or it comes with a ""leaning stick"" Very impressed I want to purchase another for myself","August 17, 2019",Can-dice
Easy to use,5.0,"Easy to use with buttons on the back or a handy remote. The instructions are not very helpful but the frame is easy to use with large icons and the remote works very well. Just load up photos, videos and music on a memory card and insert it into the frame, press start and you're ready to view well lit and sharp images.","November 17, 2020",Danomite
Picture Perfect,5.0,"The perfect digital photo frame to display pictures in a slideshow and with multiple features. Some of these extra features are autorotation, clock, alarm, calendar, plays music and videos. I have multiple videos in different formarts and they can all be played on this digital photo frame without changing the format and saves me time. Great giftable item.","January 15, 2020",SinduJT
Very nice picture framw,4.0,"This review is for the 15"" model. The picture frame offers great resolution, the colors are vibrant and the viewing angle is good. I like the fact that it comes with a 32 GB microSD with an adapter to SD so no need to buy separate memory. The only thing I find missing is a random feature i.e. it doesn't play the pictures randomly and since it's a picture frame, I think it should have the features of a picture frame before playing music and videos. The build quality of the remote is very low, it feels like a dollar store gadget, I'm not sure how long it will work. I did not try the music nor the movie features so I have no comment on the sound quality.","April 1, 2020",Benoit l.
Perfect digital photo frame with great picture quality,5.0,"This is a wonderful digital frame with great picture quality. Much better than what I expected. It comes with a 32 gb memory card and remote which is great, so, I didn’t have to buy the card extra. It’s perfect for office table or side table. Because it works with adapter, so, you need to put it close to a socket. All in all great buy at a good price","March 25, 2020",kanishka batra
Overall i'm impressed but...Wall Hanging sucks,4.0,I love the quality of the display. i would like it better if i could keep my pictures in their labeled sub folders but its not a huge issue. It would also be great if i could schedule a on off time based on weekdays vs weekends instead of just by time of day. The wall mounting options does such if you only want to use the hanger holes as there is no template for hanging.,"April 7, 2020",Amazon Customer
Disappointing,1.0,I returned this frame as the remote did not work and the pictures were blurry. The location of the buttons at the back of the screen made it difficult to use because you can’t see what you’re pressing while looking at the screen. I got this for my parents and they had a difficult time with that aspect. I also found the settings and set-up to complicated. I returned this and got the Nix which is a better fit for me.,"February 16, 2020",Amazon customer
Product specifications are misrepresenting the actual frame resolution,1.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The product listing describes the screen resolution as 1920x1080 and this is absolutely false.  I manually prepared a photo collection with each photo measuring 1920x1080.  The photo frame displayed black bars at the top and bottom, indicating that the resolution is not as advertised. The actual resolution is nowhere to be found in the product description, packaging, or manual, and I'm immensely frustrated at the amount of time and effort I wasted.","December 6, 2019",Silvaran
Great little office addition,5.0,Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Photo frame is great quality and easy to use. I had to purchase an ad card and download my files onto it. It came with a remote control that I don't really use and store in my drawer. Photos display in loops on an hourly rotation. Overall I am enjoying this product.,"November 11, 2020",HD
Great screen,5.0,"The 1080p screen on this is very sharp and bright, basel is narrow and has no distractions on it, remote control works and is used to turn on/off or set the functions of the frame. I am surprised how good the screen on this is, I bought to return if I dont like the screen quality but it stayed. I highly recommend this","December 9, 2019",Ari
Disappointing,3.0,"Bought this to replace a 10 year old Kodak frame. The Kodak still worked fine, but was limited in the amount of pictures it could hold. This was not a particularly cheap frame and I find the picture quality to be just satisfactory, the remote has a cheap design and feel and the worst part is the picture transitions are very choppy, not smooth at all.","December 28, 2019",Amazon Customer
Faulty,1.0,"The frame I received was faulty, the slideshow would regularly freeze and the only way to fix it was to unplug it (remote/manual controls wouldn't work). The image quality and frame size were good so I would have been happy with the value for money as it was a little less expensive than others of the same size, if the unit hadn't been faulty (I guess you get what you pay for),","September 22, 2020",Amazon Customer
Seen better,3.0,"Overall the picture frame is pretty decently made with a high quality screen. The remote control is an absolute piece of garbage, very frail and buttons are very sticky to use yes, if they work at all. The only reason I kept this is the system itself is pretty good if you're using the buttons on machine itself","December 25, 2019",Kris S.
Very good quality and reasonable price,5.0,"I feel excited to receive this product. I could not wait to save some wallpapers in this gorgeous digital photo frame. The box includes digital photo frame, power cable, manual, stand and a 32GB microSD which is great. It could play music, videos and slide show of photos which is amazing. It could capture all memories of our family photos and some videos on our travel. I like the calendar and alarm. The resolution is good and it has remote control. I love this product, easy to connect to computer. I would highly recommend.","August 22, 2019",Ray
"Very nice audio , picture and video quality",5.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Looks very good hanging on my wall . Amazing audio, picture  and video quality.

Disappointing quality for the price,2.0,I recently received this digital picture frame and am fairly disappointed with it.  Image quality is mediocre at best. Pictures look pixelated and have noticeable aliasing artifacts.  I have cheap Android tablets that have a lower screen resolution and have better image quality than this unit.,"September 30, 2019",D.

Good screen size and picture quality,5.0,Got this almost a month back and had it plugged in ever since. Has a bright display so looks really nice in living room or bedroom. I have put it in bedroom and also using it as alarm clock. It's easy to get started with and has many options to customize as required. Good for gifting as well.,"March 5, 2020",@DR
Digital Photo Frame with 32GB SD Card 10 Inch Kenuo 1920x1080 High Resolution,3.0,"My Digital Photo Frame is for displaying the pictures of my different trips and I have a lot of pictures for each trip . In this Digital Photo Frame, the slide show always starts with the oldest trip. If I just want to display the pictures of my last trip, I have to stroll down many hundreds of pictures to get there and that I found quite annoying. In my previous Digital Photo Frame, I can group my pictures into folders and can select the folder for the slide show. However, this Digital Photo Frame doesn't have that convenient feature. Other than that I am quite happy with this product.","December 11, 2019",P. Wu
Landscape/Portrait Image and Video Options,5.0,"I like the function in which it automatically configures the landscape or portrait mode so I can put it on the wall in any direction I want. It has a lot of slide shows stored in it that we can use for our pictures, like Clock, Calendar, etc. I did not have to charge it for 2 days. Very good battery. I recommend this digital photo frame.","October 10, 2020",Zain Abidin
Great photo frame,5.0,"It was very easy to set up and add the pictures. The screen quality is fantastic. I love that it has a remote control, easy to turn on the frame from across the room. Extra bonus to have the memory card included.","September 24, 2019",Edward  J. Bettin
Great product,5.0,"This was a gift for family members.  They love it.  They have let me know the quality of the photos is excellent and the digital frame is easy to use.

Decent device but service is NULL,1.0,"Bought the unit back in May 2020.  The device itself is not that bad when working, but unfortunately it is totally out of commission now (Nov 2020).  I have tried to find out if it is still in warranty but of course no reply from the vendor.  I had previously sent some emails to the vendor for some other queries and zero reply as well.  The listed price was attractive but service is NULL. I will now search for a similar product from another vendor as mine is now broken.","November 11, 2020",Kiet Tran
Great clear picture,5.0,"This is a great complete package.  It comes with a stand, SD card, remote and power adapter and looks great in my living room. Downloading from my computer to the SD was easy and now we’re seeing pictures again that have been buried on my PC for years. I like the motion-detect feature so you can have it on only when you’re in the room.","August 24, 2019",jspenfold
The features work and the picture and sound is very good.,5.0,Wish the price was a bit more less but you get what you pay for. Sound and picture is very good and it reads most video files. Not sure why it reads some flv  and not all flv files. Looking forward to future purchases to decorate the home. - Cheers -,"January 10, 2020",Starman
Good picture quality and perfect size,5.0,I would say it is worth your money. It was difficult for me to change pictures on the frame in few days as i get bored of it soon. So i got this digital frame. It has amazing picture quality even if clicked with mobile. It came with a remote which works well and it has calendar on it too. I loved the way pictures change according to the time you set and changes with transition effects.,"September 5, 2019",Mirani Bhatt

Very Good Digital Photo Frame,5.0,"This digital picture frame is very good. I can load my photos, videos and I really like the calendar screen for when it’s sitting on my desk.

Its meh.,2.0,"Its pretty meh. 30% of the jpeg pics won't load on either USB stick or SD card. If you take each individual pic that won't load, alter them in Adobe and save, they'll sometimes work after. When there is hundreds of pics, it's time consuming. The video play back seems to be fine in mp4 format.","November 10, 2020",Super DAS Joeleypants FANTASTICO!!!!!!
Quality image,5.0,I'm a car salesman and I have this display cycling through past customers delivery photos. Its a good size and a great value. I've already had a few people recognize coworkers and cousins. I never really trust that 'HD' will be true 1920 X 1080p. I'm quite happy with the results.

"Extremely Fragile, spoiling what otherwise is a decent frame",1.0,"It was a nice, basic frame until it had one fall of about 6 inches onto a soft carpet, which totally shattered the screen. Really, who sells products with screens this fragile nowadays? This is like a throwback to how things were 10 years ago, when almost any tiny impact could damage a LED screen.

Generally a very good value,4.0,"I use this as a navigation tool when sailing, paired to an iPad running Navionics.  It works wonderfully, but the battery life is claimed to be “up to” 8.5 hours... and it has never lasted that long. Another problem I’ve seen is when running any of the anchor watch programs.  After a period of time, it seems the gps unit decides that we’re not moving and stops sending location information despite being left plugged in (see previous mention of battery life).","May 6, 2019",Kevin K.
Works well with iPad and google maps.,5.0,I wanted to have a unit that works with Google Maps and my iPad mini in the car and this one really works well.  I have it 'permanently' on the dash board and the Bluetooth connection to my iPad is very reliable.  I don't use the battery on the unit as it is in the car so I just leave it to run down the battery when I turn off the car.  It seems to restart every time and connect immediately. I switched from a stand-alone Garmin to the iPad/google maps approach and think each has its advantages but that is not for discussion here.,"March 14, 2017",Ronald Y
Garbage,1.0,"This thing is accurate for a minute, then less accurate than the phone gps, then disconnects with a error box indicating it’s not compatible with iPhone/iPad.

Once charged it is good for the entire day,5.0,"Although I can use my IPad using ISailor as a backup to my onboard navigation system without additional GPS input, when blue toothed linked to the XGPSA the plotter becomes much more stable and accurate.  I wouldn't be without it!  I can sit on the bridge and monitor my speed, GPS coordinates and plot my course on my IPhone or IPad and know within a 1/2 meter or less where my vessel is.  It matches up perfectly with my on board system that cost well over $7500. Once charged it is good for the entire day. Can't say enough about it.","April 15, 2016",Amazon Customer

Very disappointing. I returned it to Amazon for refund.,1.0,"Very disappointing purchase. The first thing I noticed was that the instruction booklet supplied is way out of date. For example, it gives instructions for trying to pair this receiver on android phone using android version 2.0. (Of course today, we are up to version 8). So, how many years have passed since this outdated book that was published? Secondly, it turns out that the receiver itself is not simply plug-and-play, at least on android, but rather requires a separate app to be running at all times on the phone. Of course, using up battery. This so-called helper app, also available on the Google play download, is recommended in the printed manual and also the company's website support section. You would think that at least the online support of the Dual company, could get it together to post an up-to-date instruction manual for this device. But no, it has the exact same PDF version manual which I received, referring to android version 2. Next, on the support website, under this device, it says one must download the helper app from the Google play store. It provides a link. However, clicking on the link, produces a ""page not found"" error message. So again, I believe there are plenty of indications that the Dual company is not supporting this device by any stretch of imagination. Next, when I manually went to the Google play store and examined the app called Skype Pro GPS,, the reviews are horrible. Nobody likes it. Complaints include freezing locking or crashing of the app, inability to connect devices, etc. Am I seeing a trend here? I think so. Next, I could not get this XGSP150A device to connect to my top of the line android phone (Samsung Galaxy S9+). The device was recognized by Bluetooth and paired, but regardless could not  connect. I also noted a number of Amazon reviews, perhaps mainly by pilots I think, who also complained the receiver has sometimes “disconnected” without warning.  So, what the heck use is a GPS device that you can’t rely on?  Forget it! I spent a good deal of time googling methods for getting this device to work, but, aside from seeing a fair amount of complaints from people who gave up trying and were unsuccessful, the few suggestions I was able to find did not work on my phone. So, here again we have an extra hour wasted of my time. I emailed the company on a Friday, and I do not expect to hear from them at least until next week. Which doesn't do anything for my weekend plans for using this device. So, to make a long story short, I have returned this device for Amazon refund. If you need a GPS device, I would suggest you get something else that is a dedicated GPS device, perhaps a Garmin. But not this “Dual XGPS150A” !!!","September 14, 2018",Rabbi Goldstein
Solid product but ... Customer service? Never heard of it...,4.0,"Received the product, great packaging, great instructions, paired with phone and added to Harrys Lap Timer without any difficulty! Really easy to use. However, it came shipped with the old firmware and upgrading the firmware is impossible. At the current frequency (3Hz) it makes it only slightly more precise than my phone GPS. There seems to be a problem with the required drivers to install the firmware. A problem which I flagged to their customer service which were quick to reply saying it was probably my fault (even though there are quite a lot of forums describing problems with the installation of the Prolific 2303 drivers need to recognize the XGPS). I replied with a very detailed e-mail outlining my steps (on 3 different machines, Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows XP) and I have yet to get a reply. Sent a reminder a week ago without any luck. With the right firmware this would be easily a 5-star product. Very well built and easy to use with the exception of the firmware updates. EDIT: Seems customer service woke up. I will be shipping my GPS back to get one with the proper firmware!","June 9, 2015",Sebastian Ionita
Fast and Strong Satellite Capture,5.0,"Satellite capture is quick and strong. At first, I used the Skyhawk app for Android. This marginally improved GPS navigation but Sygic and CoPilot still jumped around and seemed to get ""lost"" sometimes. Even though I had mock locations enabled, I wasn't sure that it was working properly. Whenever I launched my navigation app, the GPS icon would still show up in the notification bar on my phone. I suspected I wasn't getting true guidance from the XGPS150A. After a week or so, I switched to Bluetooth GPS to link with the XGPS150A. Navigation was much more smooth with this setup and didn't seem to get ""lost"". Also, the GPS icon was not visible in the notification bar, which tells me that the phone was not using the built-in GPS, but only the XGPS150A. Much better to use Bluetooth GPS and not the Skyhawk app.","September 7, 2018",Howard W

Can not set point tracking to a user controlled setting. e.g.. 1 point per second, per 5 seconds, per 10 sec. 1 point per 5m change, or 10m change etc. Seems sensitive enough, and the high rate of tracking would be nice for high speed driving I suppose, but produces way to many points for normal work usage.

,,"We used to use our phones as GPS units, as we both have smart phones with inbuilt GPS devices. They work quite well, and we had few problems with using them in this way - however the accuracy was not always particularly good, especially when in a city or driving on tree-lined roads. This also made our hobby difficult, as we are avid geocachers. A lot of the time, this requires a good GPS signal, even under tree cover. With our phones consistently getting lost under tree-cover, this made finding the caches much more difficult. When we decided to start placing our own caches, having a VERY accurate device was a must - but I didn't want to splash out on a hand-held GPS device that would be little to no use in the car. This bluetooth GPS has completely revolutionised our geocaching and driving! Not only does it increase the battery life on our phones by about 4x (as the GPS on phones absorb battery!) but when it's on and connected, it generally can locate us to less than a meter, even under tree cover, and in built-up areas! If you are trying to connect to anything which isn't an iPhone (we use our Android phones) - there is a little switch on the side which enables you to set it into the non-Apple mode. I recommend the 'Bluetooth GPS' app on the Play Store - but you will have to set the ""Use Insecure Connection"" to on. Once this is done, click connect and you'll be running! The unit also comes with a plethora of useful additions, including a rubber dashboard mount, an elasticated wrist strap, a USB charger and a very sturdy car charger. Very highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 12, 2013",J.Dixon
,,"Having purchased a non 4G WiFi only iPad, and then trying to use a Naviotronics navigation app, I quickly realised that the non-4G models don't have a GPS receiver. What to do? This Dual external received was the answer. It connects to the iPad via bluetooth, and once paired the program run like a dream. Easy set-up, and easy to use. I keep the receiver inside the cabin of my boat, where it has no trouble pickling up satellites, and the iPad happily sits in the cockpit telling me where I am. Perfect. I have to praise the seller too. My first unit inexplicably failed after 11 months of use - it was replaced the next day without any problems. Thank you, Dual, too, for the concerns you voiced and the help you offered.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 1, 2014",C. Hawkes
,,"My wifi-only iPad Mini does not include GPS, which is standard on the 3G version. Dual’s XGPS150A remedies this shortcoming, albeit at a price. (I paid about £69). Once you have paid though it’s pretty much all good news. The device is sensitive and pairs easily with my iPad. Even indoors (tested upstairs) it quickly acquires a full set of satellites. Dual’s free app (available from iTunes store) works fine, showing the satellite signal strength along with position, position confidence, altitude, speed and battery condition. The battery lasts for about 8 hours and takes about 3 hours to recharge via the USB connector provided. This GPS receiver works with all the maps I have tested it with but beware that some (such as Google maps) need to stream data via internet. A wifi-only iPad cannot do this. However – usually for more money! - there are plenty of downloadable maps available (eg TomTom and nautical charts), which mostly come with an app to provide other navigational information. My XGPS150A came with a 12V car charger, non-slip rubber dashboard holder and some carrying straps. It is well-made and does what I wanted.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on March 7, 2013",Dr. G.

,,"Just to say that this great little Bluetooth remote GPS antenna works perfectly with my 16Gb iPad Mini (with WiFi and 3G chip) in an aviation environment using SkyDemon.  Flew from EBCI to LFAT and back yesterday in a C172 after having tested the setup locally last week.  Total confidence, simple setup and works 110%.  It is a neat, modern-looking unit; the ""sticky pad"" accessory works great on the top of the aircraft glare shield and never moves at all.  Connection to iPad was utterly simple and quick.  If there is anything that the design engineers could look at again, I think it would have to be the armband/straps which do not appear to be to the same high design/manufacturing standards as the rest of the kit - more of an afterthought given to the apprentice to bash out!  All in all, I am delighted with the unit, and with the Amazon ""system"".  PG","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 18, 2013",Paul GEE

Amazing kit to introduce the next generation to electronics,5.0,"I had one of these kits in the early 90s as a kid and absolutely loved it. It also led me into a pretty decent career path where I work for a good company with good pay. I got this set for my 3 and 5yr old nieces and in about a week they have managed to put together about 8 of the circuits, including the AM radio transmitter. This kit has taught the 5 year old how to wire things according to the diagrams and always go over all the connections a 2nd time before she connects the battery, and so far everything has worked first time for them. Great way to help start the kiddos early and make sure we have a next generation of electronics engineers to keep the world going.","April 10, 2020",admin
Decent Price for a good electronic kit!!,4.0,Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Not very sturdy It only lasted 1 month.  Yes the transistors lasted a few months when I bought the kit earlier the Radio projects work well and the transistor's NPN can be replaced if needed. It has nice projects and it explains it very well. I like the 1.5 v and 9-volt battery tester the most Unique.,"June 12, 2018",Janet L.
Very interesting toy,4.0,I bought this for my 6 year old grandson to show him the basics of circuits. It is mostly too advanced for him. We have done some of the easier projects but it gets complicated in a hurry. It will be fine when he is older.,"January 13, 2020",Debbie O

Good learning toy!,5.0,Our 10 year old grandson loves it.  But now that the weather is finally nice I'm not sure if it is getting used much.,"June 19, 2013",Terry-Lee Stephan
,,"Amazing learning tool. Within a day of my 8 year old opening the box, he'd learned how to make his own flat screen TV from a few food tins and an old beer bottle. Macgyver eat your heart out. Would recommend. And to the guy who down scored it due to it being 'flimsy', what exactly are you expecting?  If used as a step ladder, ok granted its flimsy. As a stepping stone for future bomb disposal experts, its absolutely what id expect. If you have boys, they will love it.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 25, 2017",Mr. B. Grinnall
,,"Fortunately I was present when the youngster who received it as a Christmas present attempted to make the first project (a simple LED light & switch).  It did not work.  A quick check with a meter revealed that the battery had been connected to the wrong terminals (polarity of battery reversed).  Easily compensated if you are experienced, but it confused the youngster that he could not follow the diagrams for any of the projects but always had to swap the connections to the battery terminals.  Very shoddy quality control!!!  I have a feeling that one of the electrolytic capacitors was also reversed - if not then it was very leaky which made the bistable circuits unreliable.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 2, 2019",Kindle Customer
,,"Not happy at all with this kit. A Christmas present for my son which very quickly proved to be substandard. First I noticed that the variable resistor was connected to the spring connectors back to front and the pointer was incorrectly fitted. Then I found that the transformer didn't work. A note in the box said to contact the manufacturer, not the retailer, in the event of any defects. I sent them an email asking what I should do as I'm in the UK and they're in the USA but have not even received a response.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2019",Dave Rawson
,,I TRIED SO HARD TO FIND SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR MY 11YR OLD GRANDSON'S BIRTHDAY and this Electronic Playground was just right.

,,Bought this for my 7-year-old.

Great organizer,5.0,"As a Mac guy with all these adaptors, I really enjoy this case. It’s great for travel, or just staying organized around the house or the office. The only thing that could have made it better is having a little bit better structure, something hard embedded between the fabrics that enables a bit better sturdyness.","February 29, 2020",Matt
"Good Size, Dividers are nice.",4.0,"This is a good case (I have a few, good and bad) the velcro dividers are great for customizing. The size is good without being huge. The one complaint is that it arrives, flat packed in a bag, and the side walls now have a crease in them which keeps it from holding its shape.  I would have appreciated if it was packed with some paper to maintain its form.","April 16, 2020",MKITGO2
For Dr J projector,5.0,"Product just arrived today. I bought this bag to carry my Dr J mini projector, and it fits great. All the cords and remote fit in the straps on the lid. There’s a little room beside the projector for my HDMI to AV converter too. The bag doesn’t offer much padding protection, but I don’t plan on being rough with my projector. Overall I’m very happy.","May 18, 2020",Nathan
Does the Job & Great Material,4.0,I purchased the smaller organizer. I was very happy with the material and size of the organizer however not impressed with the velcro for separators.

Cheap but does the job,3.0,This was affordable but feels flimsy.  The zippers feel like they could burst open if packed too full.  Other wise does the job of holding electronics and I like how you can adjust the dividers.  The mesh pockets in the lid part is also useful!,"November 3, 2020",J.Kanamoto

The Cloth Works Really Well,5.0,For some reason the new Macbook Air 2020 screens are very hard to clean compared to the older macbooks. I got a fingerprint on my screen and was unable to clean it. When I tried other methods of cleaning it the fingerprint just got worse and spread. I tried to take it to the Apple store but they could not figure out how to clean the screen and made it worse. I thought I would buy this cloth since it was close to 5$. I bought two since after reading reviews I wanted to use one cloth as my dry and one as a wet cloth. I turned off my laptop and let it sit for an hour. After I used the dry cloth to wipe my laptop. Sprayed water on the 2nd cloth and wiped my laptop and then used the dry cloth again. The fingerprint along with the rest of the smudges were gone. I really like it and think it is worth the money.,"November 7, 2020",Baveeta
Great for my smartphone,5.0,"I love this on my smartphone. I don't have to use water just a quick wipe and everything is clean. Great for my MS surface and tablet. Its nice to have these small ones, otherwise big microfiber cloths do a good job as well but this is nice because it fits in my pocket and is washable!","June 15, 2020",gp

"Eco friendly, chemical free, great results!",5.0,"I am one of those crazy people that loves to clean my house and has all of the fancy cleaning gadgets to do it with. If you're like me, this cloth is a MUST HAVE. It cleans my TVs easily and perfectly. I just glide the cloth over the screen, and it takes EVERYTHING OFF (even puppy nose marks, husband finger prints, and sneeze spots!) The best part is that it does this with NO water! This cloth, dry, leaves my TV screens impeccable. This cloth actually grabs and holds all of the dust that it picks up - no pushing dirt around. And because it's dry, no risk of damaging my electronics. This cloth works great for cell phones, lap top and tablet screens as well. Completely streak free finish. I love being able to clean my screens without chemicals. I also love that I pop this cloth in the wash, hang it up to dry, and it's ready go go again. Chemical free, eco friendly, great results. I will be purchasing more  of these cloths to put into stockings for my extended family at Christmas. Every home needs one! I'm happy with this purchase, I feel it was $5 well spent. This cloth will last years!","August 19, 2019",EmmSaRich

Here’s what we figured out...,5.0,I did read reviews that coffee had plastic taste but our first cups were great. Then next morning yep there it was that plastic sort of smell and taste. Was going to return but we finally figured it out!! It’s when the water sits in the reservoir. We get same taste sometimes if water sits in our water jug in fridge. Now we just add the fresh water before we make our cup. No biggy really and I’m glad as it’s very cute and great size for my kitchen.,"June 27, 2019",Gail Di Pietra
Perfect Keurig for Smaller Kitchens ... Compact Size - Full Size Performance,5.0,"This is the Perfect Keurig Machine when counter space is limited. We have a full size Keurig K50 machine at home however the kitchen at our lake cabin is a lot smaller and counter space is at a premium. This Keurig K35 machine is about the same depth as the K50 machine but 30% narrower.  The water reservoir is at the back of the K35 machine instead of the size and is smaller.  You get two full large cups of your favorite beverage before needed to refill the reservoir. If you're having company and need to make several cups of coffee at a time then the full sized Keurig K50 machine is probably a better choice since you will not have to refill the reservoir as often.  If you have a small kitchen and only need to make one or two cups of coffee in the morning and occasionally throughout the day or evening this compact K35 would do the job while saving you counter space.  Other places where the smaller K35 would work best .... apartments, campers, trailers, cottages and anybody who only drinks a couple of cups a coffee a day. Take a look at the pictures.  The Keuring K35 machine similar in size to a large roll of paper towel. Compact Size with Full Size Performance  ...  Highly Recommend.","February 9, 2018",The Tech Guy
"Great taste, great tempurate, great size.",5.0,"1 year later: I use this machine every day, up to 3 times a day. I make coffee and tea (no k-cup, just water). I live in an area with hard water. I never use filtered water in my keurig, but I do clean with out with a vinegar+filtered-water solution every 3 months. After over a year, the machine still works great, though it is noisier than when I first got it. I absolutely love this coffee machine! A regular sized Keurig is too big for my counter. This coffee machine makes great tasting coffee super quickly. This one makes coffee that is plenty hot enough for everyone. I love hot coffee so this compact machine perfect for me (my boyfriend doesn't so he actually has to wait for his to cool down!) Some people complained about plastic taste even after running hot water through the machine. What people don't realise, though is that you should take the reservoir out and wash it thoroughly before running hot water through the machine. I did this and had no taste issues.","January 5, 2019",Anonymous
Makes hot coffee that tastes fine,5.0,"I can't speak to durability, as I only got this yesterday.  However I was quick to wash the reservoir out with dish liquid, as one previous reviewer had suggested, since there were many complaints that there was a plastic taste.  (Post production grit cannot just be rinsed off - you have to wash it, like you'd wash any dishes.)  I've had a bad experience with a much earlier Keurig model that did not brew hot coffee.  I need my coffee hot, and this is more than sufficient.  I think a hundred bucks is steep for a coffee maker, but as compared to other Keurig models, it was the best price for one that had such high reviews.  The reservoir is a bit of a pain in the arse, being located on the back.  I can't take it in and out to refill very easily, like I could with my old Keurig that had a reservoir on the side, so I have to refill it from glasses of water - but not a deal-breaker.  All in all, happy with my purchase.","February 28, 2019",Amazon Customer
Good for a couple,4.0,"My old Keurig K60 finally died after 7 years of almost daily use. I wanted something with a reservoir but it didn't have to be big. This model seemed to suit our needs. This model works just fine. I did notice that the pump is a bit louder than my previous model. It seems to heat up faster, but I can't be sure. Overall, this is great for a couple as the reservoir is really only good enough for 2 big cups of coffee before you'd need to refill it.","January 6, 2019",Karl A Plesz
Plastic taste,2.0,Unfortunately mine had the common problem of plastic taste.. tried to get rid of it but it won’t go away.. had to return it,"October 1, 2018",Tony
Good ...,4.0,I like the fact that it is simple and no-nonsense to operate. 3 months and no problem at all. One small thing... The top edge of the reservoir in the back is shaped like a crescent curved downward. So it is hard to see if the water will overflow during re-fill ... specially hard to see under the kitchen cabinet.,"September 21, 2018",Amazon Customer
PERFECTION for your coffee needs!,5.0,"The Keurig K35 Compact Hot Brewing system was EXACTLY what we were looking for to fit in our apartment; we saved space while still able to receive the perfect coffee within seconds!  I was afraid to choose one of the many versions available, but I now know that this was the perfect match for me!","September 7, 2018",Amazon Customer
"DO NOT BUY WAREHOUSE ""DEAL""",2.0,"Warning if you are going to buy ""warehouse inspected"".. they don't inspect anything The unit came disaligned on casing, I took it apart and put it back correctly. Not it disaligned anymore. Few clips were broke, back water tank doesn't fit properly.. and whole unit was soaked, including inside, which can't be good for any electrical. Makes the strangest noises, (I've heard a keireg and tassimo) it's like it's on its last legs. Not impressed at all.. I won't be buying ""warehouse inspected"" again.. what a shame.. but I was warned, Soni saved 40$ and got a unit that will likely break within the week","October 28, 2019",George H
Might be a larger appliance than you thought,5.0,"It turned out to be a lot bigger than I thought it would be! Most of the size is at the back of the machine though, where the water vessel is housed. Pretty easy to use from the box. Remove transport tape, rinse water vessel, do short run-through with water first. Takes 3 minutes for ""initial set-up"" then so easy to use for coffee! Bought as a gift for my mother. Uses same Keurig  pods that my other Keurig machine at home uses. Easy and makes great coffee fast!","June 11, 2020",Me
Keurig makes sub standard coffee machines,1.0,"I ordered a Keurig coffee maker that was exactly like the last one I had (which wouldn't allow me to press the brew buttons). When I received the new Keurig, it looked exactly the same as the last one, but it would not allow me to use the reusable coffee filter pods which I had used in the previous one. I have had to buy at least 4 or 5 Keurigs in the past 5 years - they do not last long, but I love the idea of having a fresh cup of coffee each time... It seems to me that Keurig purposely changes their machines so that you can not use parts/filters from previous ones. They just want to make money, not satisfy the public. I will no longer buy any Keurig machine - very disappointed!","November 3, 2019",Amazon Customer
Works perfect for family of two people!,5.0,"I read a lot of reviews before I bought it. Some reviews were positive, some negative. We have a small kitchen downstairs and haven't had a coffee machine there and when we spend time there watching TV or working at the computer we always run upstairs to get a cup of coffee.  So, when I saw this coffee machine I was sure it was exactly what we needed for family of two people. And it works perfect for us. It is small but enough for two cups of coffee and it fits our small kitchen. Some people wrote that it was a plastic smell, but we rinse it as instruction said and there isn't any small. We are pleased, satisfied and love our small coffee machine.","December 21, 2019",Valentina Steigenga
Think twice!,1.0,"I purchased the machine for my office. After the first use, water was leaking from the base and created a huge mess. Amazon customer service was helpful and put me in touch with a Keurig customer representative. On the phone they said all the right things but when it came down to replacing my machine while still under warranty, they made it incredibly difficult to get a new one. Excercise caution when buying Keurig. I have yet to receive my replacement.","August 2, 2020",Darcy Grant
Great coffee maker,5.0,I am a casual coffee drinker and this has lasted me a couple years now.  It's a good smaller compact machine and doesn't seem to take much room in my limited space kitchen.  I can get about 3 or 4 large cups from a tank of water.  I use a stainless steel reusable Kcup with it for sustainable options and I love this system.,"July 8, 2020",Jennifer L.
Life saver,5.0,"Honestly...have you ever gone days without coffee? I did...2 to be exact. When my coffee maker (not a Keurig) decided it was over worked and underpaid, much like myself, it decided to quit. Luckily, I found this beauty on sale and it was at my door step only 2 days after ordering. It's gorgeous and makes an amazing cup of coffee. I can now safely leave my home.","May 22, 2019",Marie
Who really knows how coffee is made ?,5.0,"I love this machine.  Fits on your counter, 4 buttons, easy to use, no extra krap.  Push start get coffee.  Who has the time to set up all that equipment, boil water, find filters and a spoon to scoop out a mystery amount of coffee grounds and get a mystery cup of coffee ?  I love that this has a large water tank.  The future has arrived.  Get this. You'll be glad you did.","May 31, 2020",Freddy2Dogs
Great Brewer,5.0,"After almost 10 years, I had to retire my original Keurig brewer for my office and this was the replacement. It has a couple of improvements that I like - it heats up faster than the predecessor. Also, I like that once I drop the K-Cup in, I can select my brew size while it's heating up. The water tank is a bit smaller than my previous Keurig, but I've just learned to fill  a separate jug with water to lower the number of times I have to go fill up the tank. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.","February 19, 2019",Isherlaufer
Beware,1.0,Wéve purchase two at differing times.. Beware as they can cause a instantaneous fire.  The first one burnt our outlets by overheating and luckily the power surge tripped.  The second started to boil on it’s own (never put it on).  Luckily it happened while we were watching TV.  Other reviews on line mention the same.  These should be pulled from the market.,"August 29, 2020",None
Gets louder and louder,2.0,"I got my keurig 4 months ago but held off writing a review until I knew how it held up. The plastic taste people are talking about, you don't get that if you don't leave your water sitting in the machine.Only a minor inconvience. I have cleaned mine twice in the 4 months in which I have owned it and it still gets louder and louder.Tho I do like the convience of using the kcups","November 9, 2019",holly
Can't really complain much for my first Keurig machine,4.0,"Being my first Keurig, I really do like it. It does what i want it to do, and doesn't make a mess doing it, but my only complaint, and the only reason it gets 4 stars out of 5 is it does feel cheap. The handle you use to lift the top and press it down is plastic, not metal, and I worry about putting too much pressure on it and it breaking. If it was given a metal handle then it would be much better.","June 10, 2019",Brad
Hubby happy as a clam!,5.0,"Nespresso broke down and I can’t go get fixed but I’ve stopped drinking coffee so hubby was never more happy to spend money as he loves Keurig more than anything....including me some mornings! Works great and we used to have the big silver/stainless one waaaayyyyyy back but this has all the bells and whistles and instant hot water for tea. It’s a great machine at a great price and good warranty. I personally still love my Nespresso but since I’m not drinking coffee anymore , I can’t argue. He’s happy, I’m happy.....now...I think diamond earrings are on sale.....","May 16, 2020",Tovah
I love it !,5.0,"I receieved it on time, the packaging was really well made. I am super happy with this keurig machine, it took two seconds to set it up. I have not tried it yet, although I will tomorrow! I'm sure it won't be a disappointment. I love this machine it's really well made , perfect size doesn't take a lot of room on the counter. It's honestly perfect and the price is a steal!","May 27, 2020",Amazon Customer
Love My Kuerig,5.0,"Love Love Love it! My old coffee maker kicked the bucket, love that I can make just one cup at a time, fresh hot cup every time. Some people complained about a plastic taste, I however didn't have this, probably because I washed it before using it for the first time.","March 26, 2020",The Feeling of Beauty
Don’t waste your money,1.0,"I bought this so I would stop with the expensive coffee orders 2-3 times a day.  I knew that the Keurig coffee makers didn’t last very long, but I was hoping I’d at least get a couple years out of it. I purchased this less than 8 months ago and it has already met its untimely death.","March 6, 2020",M. S.
Purchased in late May Quite working September 16 Very Poor Value,1.0,This Keurig was a replacement for a previous model that was bigger and had lasted for over 4 years.  Cost of owning previous unit $3.25 per month the unit of this review $25.71 per month.  Only one coffee drinker used and although made very good coffee while working.  This short life span will have me looking for an alterative product.,"September 17, 2020",BCRON
Inferior Frothing Capability,2.0,"When I first bought this frother I was really impressed as it frothed well - just as well as my Nespresso unit at home. No longer. It does still frother but nowhere near as much so I'm returning it and buying another Nespresso (this is for my office). Sometimes the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" really is true. Seems to be applicable in this instance for sure.","March 16, 2020",Derek Gagnier
No more Tassimo,5.0,"I have been using a Tassimo coffee maker for over 10 years.  My latest one is slowly going down hill, so  I tried to obtain a new Tassimo.  THEY DON'T MAKE THEM ANYMORE.  I don't like change but I was forced to switch to  Keurng and you know what - I like it.  Have only used it for a day or so but I like it.","May 2, 2020",Welsh One
Excellent choix,5.0,"Très satisfaite de mon achat. À la base je l’ai acheté pour remplacer ma tassimo qui n’avait pas l’option de filtre réutilisable et je ne regrette pas du tout mon choix en plus d’en avoir plus pour mon argent avec les sacs de grains. Le café est excellent et chaud et le format est parfait pour ne pas encombrer le comptoir! Seule chose est qu’un réservoir est bon pour environ deux cafés il faut donc la remplir souvent, ce qui pour moi n’est pas un problème.","October 27, 2019",marie-michèle
VERY practical and fun !,5.0,"for the price, its perfect. there are so many flavours to choose from, the hot chocolate was a major + for my kids. I would buy it again.... you cant go wrong with kieurig (not sure about the spelling) :)","August 28, 2018",Steve Lachance
Does the trick,4.0,"I bought this Keurig for my other half who likes his cup of java each day.  I , am a tea drinker so wanted something that didn't dominate the counter top.  This one seemed to meet our needs.  It is simple to use and my other half is impressed by how fast the coffee is made. My one issue with this item is finding refillable K cups for this machine.  I have been searching high and low to find reusable cups for this model.. K-35. There are refillable cups for the hundred other Keurig machines but not this compact model.","September 8, 2019",Catherine Head
Boff avec bug,1.0,Encore trop grosse pour ce quel fais... bug toujours une fois sur deux elle ne réchauffe pas l’eau ou dois prend 4/5 essaie avant d’avaler l’eau d’un coup... très décevant... à éviter !,"July 20, 2020",MEM
Much better than I thought,5.0,"Since i have been working from home full time now, i caved in and bought this coffee maker. It is the same brand my office was using but in a newer model. I have used it for a whole month now, other than it is a bit loud when the water was heating up, everything else is prefect! It makes coffee super fast and I enjoy my morning coffee every day now thanks to this! Also don’t need to run out and buy a coffee save lots of time! Definitely will recommend to those who are now working from home :)","August 31, 2020",AZ
HOT Coffee,5.0,"I took advice from another review and washed the reservoir with hot water and dish soap before brewing coffee, no plastic taste at all.  The unit is compact and brews a nice, fresh, HOT cup of coffee.  I am very pleased and would recommend this brewer.","May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer
Not really happy with this model,3.0,It looks great but the water holder is light plastic type material and you have to be careful with replacing it every time you clean. I got what I paid for!,"October 26, 2018",Anne Fletcher
Great Product,4.0,"Had the same model that purchased at a local supplier.  It crapped out, so ended up buying this one off Amazon.  After using it, realized that this one worked so much better from the last one.  The last one must of had a flaw, and that is why it broke.  This new one is smooth and easy to use.","December 27, 2019",Randy DeJong
Good value!,5.0,"Amazon has great deals! Picked this up on a daily deal and it works great. Kureig products always do work well so it’s no surprise there but it’s always nice to save a bit of money. Heats up quickly, and brews a nice cup of coffee. Grab some reusable pods if you want to reduce your waste footprint. There are some great ones on here as well. All in all very happy with this machine","May 11, 2019",Ryan T
Compact and easy to use,5.0,"Got this for my mom after her Tassimo died, which she loved but they are no longer available in Canada. Mom is quite happy with this Keurig. She lives in a residence and doesn't have much space but this very compact and easy to use. She's been using it for a month so far and no complaints (and trust me, she'd let me know what f there was anything to complain about!)","March 19, 2020",moogle
Great coffee maker,5.0,"This is a great coffee maker. My husband uses it twice a day and we have had it for months no with no issues. We started with the single Keurig maker and it lasted 6 weeks. We bought another one and it also lasted 6 weeks so we were reluctant to buy another one. This larger , better made one has been great. It is quick and not too noisy.","August 22, 2020",Nancy
"A Really well designed instant/brewing, single cup coffee maker!",5.0,"I bought this a little while ago. It is very easy to use, looks great and the coffee pods brew great coffee pretty quickly and cleanly for that matter;  also the water resouvoir refills nicely with my Brita water filter... I  think that it is an overall, very-well designed product! Thanks!","March 18, 2020",Sam B.
Compact but small reservoirs,3.0,This is the 3rd Keurig I’ve bought.  Each time they were around 100 bucks and each one was not quite as good as the last one.  This one has a small reservoir and overall seems more clunky when using.  The water is definitely hotter then my last one and you do get a “decent” cup of coffee from it.  I noticed lately it went on sale for 60.00 which is where a fair price point should be.,"July 18, 2019",I. M. Annie
Well brewed coffee,5.0,"For me the K-Cup brewing method seems to be the best to get exactly one cup of freshly brewed (not espresso pressed) coffee. On my last Canada trip I ordered the machine to be sent to my hotel. Everything went fine. AND: Appreciation to Amazon Canada for billing and accounting everything to my German Amazon account without loosing money by currency conversion. Great thing. To be improved: I am Amazon prime member in Germany. I was obviously not Canadian prime member, had to make a free trial membership. Why am I not ""worldwide"" member ?  And sorry for not rating ""durability"". Ask me in 10 years.","January 29, 2019",BK
Keurig Amazon Warehouse Deal,5.0,"I bought this as an Amazon Warehouse item saving about $10. It was 100% brand new, product was still had all manufacturer packaging, outside box had just been retaped. Keurig works amazing and not a single scratch or dent on the actual item. Works 100% perfect! I highly reccomend checking out the Amazon Warehouse deals before paying full price!","April 30, 2020",Allison
Turned out pretty dependable after all,5.0,"Well it worked great for 7 months but then quit, I suspect using those coffee ground adapters put too much strain on it, or it got wet or something as all the lights stay lit constantly. Avoid adapters and I suspect you would be fine, coffee comes out pretty hot too, but if you put it in a cold cup w cold spoon and drown it in creamer it will likely get cold, like all coffee does, as the laws of thermodynamics still apply. This was used fairly regularly at least 10 or more times a day for around 7 months, so I guess that is acceptable. EDIT: It came back to life! long live Keurig!","October 14, 2020",Cruz Bonner
No regret on selfish purchase.,4.0,"Really enjoying all the different styles of hot beverages available. Coffee (of course), tea, latte, hot chocolate, and all those with flavors as well. I will definitely have a hot drink to keep me warm on the cold winter days. The machine takes up very little room on my counter. Makes a cup within minutes that is nice and hot. Do not regret this purchase for myself.","October 10, 2019",Jessica
Not working correctly,2.0,The one I got seems to be defective ; It has three settings depending on the size of coffee cup one desires but even at the largest setting it only fills an average coffee cup 3/4 full.. I’m thinking of selling a bag,"August 21, 2020",Amazon Customer
I miss my Tassimo,4.0,after 15 years my Tassimo died could not find another to I had to settle for Keurig It's not made as well a little flimsy have yet to find a coffee that I like yes I would buy it again if I could not find a Tassimo,"August 28, 2019",moxy1948

Really Glad I Made this Purchase,5.0,I came to K-Cups a little late but the switch over has been a life-changer.  I do need and also reusuable pods.

The size is perfect for our limited counter space.,"April 25, 2020",Dennis S Hurd

Very very good coffee maker,5.0,"I don't know why it asked me to rate the 'thickness' of it.. but okay.  I've always wanted a keurig and this is a great option. It works well, I make coffee, hot chocolate and tea. I just run a hot water rinse between them so no flavour transfer and works great. Love it.","August 30, 2020",Jph4375

Overall good,5.0,The keurig coffee maker is perfect I wish it was more adorable it’s very expensive but I am impressed with it so far it’s working pretty well it’s good quality. It’s simple to use very straightforward it’s just a bit pricy but you get what you pay for with it is definitely worth it,"August 24, 2019",Miranda Grant
"Not great, not bad.",3.0,"Not as compact as you would expect a ""Compact"" Keurig to be. But it does have a very compact washer reservoir. It needs to be filled after 2 cups. And it's max size for a cup of coffee is only 10oz. So it definitely isn't great or impressive, but it does make good coffee (because I buy good k-cups) quickly when I'm trying to get out the door at 6AM, so... I give it a solid ""it's more convenient than the French press"".","October 18, 2020",Caitlin DelBello
Very Reliable,5.0,"I really like this coffee maker - it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but it works consistently and reliably, delivering great coffee every time. I'm a new Keurig user - this unit stopped once, and we called support and learned that we weren't cleaning it properly.  They were super nice and walked us through the 3 minute cleaning process and got us caffeinated again. I love the colour, and would buy this again.","September 1, 2020",Jordan Fortier
Love my Keurig. Got the red one,5.0,Love my keurig. I got it during a one day sale during boxing week so it was a great deal! It is really easy to use and clean. I bought the reusable filter so I can use my own type of coffee.,"January 25, 2019",Maria
"Compact, no frills model. Needs smaller cup size.",3.0,"This model can pour 3 sizes of coffee, the smallest being 6 oz. or 3/4 cup. The portions are too large in my opinion - it won’t pour you an espresso sized cup. Sometimes the volume of water poured changes suddenly, but turning the machine off and on corrected this. Seems to have a computer problem.","June 7, 2019",DC
Help,2.0,Need help. Bought this machine and was getting a burning plastic taste. Do returned it and got another one. Tried it at home and worked great . Brought it to work this morning and it won't turn on . Lights just keep blinking. unplugged  it a few times still not coming on or heating up,"April 1, 2019",Phil

"Scam, should be removed from Amazon.",1.0,"This no longer works.  I bought it and was all excited to use it.  Feels like good quality but one major catch: it will not connect with new phones and requires an app to do so which has been removed from the Google play app store. There is no way to connect it and it is a hoax.  I'm returning this and you should not buy this.  Run, this is a complete scam and is very frustrating.  I work in a major game studio and know what I'm talking about.","April 24, 2019",TJ
I purchased this controller a year and a half ago ...,1.0,"I purchased this controller a year and a half ago, and only lightly used it. At some point, it started sending inputs from the right joystick whenever I move the _left_ joystick, making most games unplayable. The controller was sold with a 2 year warranty, but I've been unable to get a real response from the company. The phone number listed in the manual is disconnected. I've filed several support tickets with PowerA, and they keep deleting them! Phone support was no help either.","December 27, 2017",deviantintegral
"Decent, but I've had some problems",3.0,"I've had this for a while and it's a decent controller with some issues for me.  The controls feel a bit stiff for my liking and don't have the refined feel you get from a Xbox or Playstation controller but I have little worry that this controller will break.  It feels solid, and it has a pretty good built-in battery so you can actually use it for a while.  I did find it difficult to actually get it connected to my phone at times, and I had some issues occasionally in some games with delayed input and sometimes the controller would completely stop working.  This could all be my phone, and I've had it work great for me sometimes as well, so who knows.","December 27, 2018",Chris M
Very Nice and Responsive. App and Manual Useless.,4.0,"Bought this to use with my Android and love it. It can be top heavy if you're playing with the phone in the holder. I usually set my hands on my knees to avoid fatigue. Very responsive, love the joystick movement. Not entirely sure what the app is for, it literally does nothing. When you open it it just gives you some controller mapping options and a list of the games you want to use it for. But you can usually do the same thing Inside games with controller support. The instructions that some with it are meh. Basically, the main things to know is; Bluetooth (flashing buttons = connecting, solid button = connected); pressing the battery button beside the charging LED will display your charge level; and the flashing battery LED means it's plugged in. It won't tell you if it's done charging. Still don't know what A and B mean on the Off Switch. Highly recommend for Android gamers.","May 17, 2020",Reagan M.
"Great, with minor flaws.",4.0,"I've had the Power A MOGA Pro Power controller for a little over a month and thus far I've been pretty happy with it. First the bad stuff; I've had some issues with the controller pairing with my phone (OnePlus 6) and for some reason when I turn the controller on by flipping the switch to the left, the A side, it won't pair. But when I flip it right, the B side, it works fine. It also seems to sometimes have problems pairing to my phone. But that's not often. The controller also feels a tiny bit too wide, but it's such a minor complaint. The good is it's a pretty quality build. The buttons, triggers, analog sticks and d-pad all feel good. I'm actually surprised by how good the buttons feel; they're not quite at an Xbox One controllers level of comfort and quality but it's close. I'm using it right now to play Hexen and Doom on an N64 emulator and it's fantastic. Everything is responsive and buttons map to the emulator without issue. The built in battery is without a doubt worth the higher price. Charging your phone from the controller is great. It won't charge it super fast, but it gets the job done. I was skeptical when I first decided to buy this controller, but I'm very satisfied with it. If you're like me and mostly just want to use it for emulators I think it's a great choice. It works well with the GC emulator; N64, PS1, all work great. If it didn't have the pairing issues I probably would have given this a 5 star, but it's pretty close to it.","October 20, 2018",Eric
Manufacturer does not honor warranty,1.0,"I bought this controller in 2016 and only played with it a couple times until recently, when I started using it for 3-4 hours a week, but after about 2-3 weeks the left joystick started going. It was sending inputs to my device as if pressed to the right. According to someone on the internet, making circles with it and turning off and on the controller would fix it, which it did, but only for a couple minutes. This issue makes it unusable as characters or cars in game keep going right when the joystick is centered. The warranty was still valid so I contacted support through their website on multiple occasions but they never got back to me. There is no phone number that I can find to call them so I'm out of luck. I can't tell if I simply got a bad unit as this looked like a quality product at first, but one thing it for sure it's worth nothing now if I can't even get a repair or replacement under warranty. Instead of this product, I bought an Xbox One S (bluetooth) controller and a phone holder, both sold on Amazon. And now my controller also works natively on the computer. It's worth noting that the games that will be compatible on Android with the Xbox controller versus the Moga may vary... and phones as well, but I've personally been using it to play computer games over the Steam Link application and that works beautifully.","May 4, 2019",S. Hetu
"Well built, but lacks app support",3.0,"Controller arrived on time and was well packaged.  I was surprised at how solid the controller felt, it feels well built.  Connection to my phone was easy.  This would be a 5 star review if it wasn't for the fact that there is no current app by Moga.  Unless a game has built in support for a controller, you will be unable to use this without rooting your phone and using third party apps.  A real shame, because this is a solid piece of hardware and is largely unusable.","September 16, 2018",Joshua Wood
great for the price,5.0,"When I flip this open in front of people and start paying retro games on my phone, they go ballistic and everyone wants one.  A bit short on range to my TV but thats likely the BT receiver.  Has built in charger which is a bonus, stays charged for a long time. Feels ok in hands but I think the A B X Y buttons are reversed by default on some games using snes emu.  All in all, great for the price! Some reviews state that the Moga software won't work on Android Marshmellow (6.01) I can confirm they've udpated apps in the app store and this device will work in both bluetooth modes A and B","December 2, 2016",Andrew W Baker
Like an Xbox 360 controller for your smartphone.  Does exactly what I need it to do.,4.0,"Have used this a little bit over the past few months, I'm not much of a portable gamer but I wanted something for when I'm going to be away from my other games for a while.  Can't give a durability report, but in terms of comfort and functionality I can say it's quite good.  The Moga App is basically useless for anything other than connecting in Mode A, hence -1 star, but the controller itself is great. I use it on a big Moto X Play phone and the holder accommodates it with ease and holds it snugly.  Buttons all feel great, and battery life seems good (haven't tried charging my phone with the controller, since my phone requires a lot of juice from the wall adapter).  Controller is very comfortable in the hands if you like Xbox 360 controllers. Last but not least, game compatibility is hit and miss, which is to be expected on Android.  Many games will work in Mode B because it either naturally accepts it, or controls can be reassigned in game menus, example: Modern Combat 5.  Mode A will work in some games, but without Moga App support, 90% of the time you'll be using Mode B  (HID).  Mode B doesn't require the Moga App at all, just hooks up with Bluetooth.  Mode A requires the app, otherwise I wouldn't have it. Overall, I recommend this product, it's great for retro / entry level / casual Android gamers like me who hate getting stuck with touchscreens and cramped hands.  By the way Moga, thanks for adding Mode B!","March 30, 2016",Amazon Customer
Perfect gamepad for Android,5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal device. It's xbox style layout is perfect, even for someone used to playstation style gamepad this one feels good and holds my Samsung s7 snug. Very comfortable to play long hours with, still change how you look at mobile gaming permanently. With built in battery ignore all others that use throw away batteries you can even plug your phone into this one comes with a small wire from gamepad to phone and a longer one to connect the gamepad to a charger. Included was a stand for tablet players. 5 stars, will buy more as gifts, perfectly priced.","March 28, 2017",Rick
Very solid controller.,4.0,"Good construction. The buttons and sticks are bit noisy, but they're solid. Connectivity with my note 8 is flawless. D-pad doesn't pop as much as I'd like, but it still works well. There seems to be a tiny bit of input lag when I have wifi on, but turned off it seems a tiny bit better. It's overall not really noticeable unless you are trying to play on a tv that it itself has input lag. The lag is not necessarily the controller's fault, though. One gripe I have with this controller, and the reason for it losing a star, is that the flip-up latch that holds the phone isn't as stable as I'd like. It will occasionally fall; my phone's weight with case on is heavy enough that it will cause it to fold onto my fingers while playing. This happens regularly if I tilt the controller toward me too far, or I am playing on my back. If there was a way to lock it in place it would be perfect.","February 1, 2019",Adrian
Depreciated item.,1.0,"Unfortunately, the core product arrives DOA. The supporting software no longer exists. The pamphlets inside warn you not to use half of the settings on the controller. It's a shame as this is clearly a well designed product.... It just no longer functions the way it was designed to. Incompatible with major mobile titles such as Fortnite for Android also. Quite frankly, I'm shocked it's "" Amazon's choice"" when it's not functional.","November 21, 2019",Alan
Excellent controller (Just make sure to use 'B' mode!),5.0,"This controller is fantastic! I always loved the Xbox 360/One controller design (which this clearly emulates) so it feels very natural to use. I use it in conjunction with my Samsung Galaxy S7 to play emulators, as well as playing games like Minecraft in virtual reality with my Gear VR. The aforementioned ease of use is especially important in VR when you can't easily look down at the controller (without removing the headset)! The controller itself has all the buttons you'd expect, even including L3 and R3 (ie: the analog sticks click in to act as a button). The buttons and d-pad feel rather 'clicky', which is a double edged sword; it's nice to have the tactile response, but in practice it can be a little loud when the action gets heated. The analog sticks are excellent, and the triggers, while just a shade less satisfying than the Xbox versions, are responsive and have a nice amount of 'travel'. The battery is huge, and still shows full charge after I've used the controller for quite a few hours. (Full disclosure: I'm still on my first charge, and, while it's a welcome option to have, I haven't yet attempted to charge my phone via the controller battery.) Word to the wise: Never put the controller in 'A' configuration (even though the instructions will tell you otherwise). To the unaware, the controller lets you turn it on in either 'A' or 'B' mode. The former is supposed to be used in conjunction with an app, which has limited support (and, from what I've heard, is no longer being updated). The latter is just a standard Bluetooth controller mode, which has been 100% compatible with everything I've tried. I've seen a lot of people complain about the controller, when all their issues would be resolved if they just used the 'B' configuration. Ultimately, although I initially thought this controller was a bit on the expensive side, I now see it to be worth every penny. Definitely pick it up if you're looking for console-quality Bluetooth controller.","May 26, 2016",Louis
Great controller,5.0,"For a mobile controller, it is really great.  Works great with my Galaxy S7 and my emulators without needing to use their app. Works also great on my linux laptop with Steam games (tho it needed some configuration on Steam).  Didn't try it on my desktop as I have a wired controller. Great battery life, as a life saver feature where it turns itself off when not used for a time and it can be used as a power bank.","April 2, 2019",Jolan Sergerie-Jeannotte
Perfect for the Gear VR,5.0,"Works great for my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone. I use it for my ""Gear VR"" and haven't had a problem with any games yet!! Just make sure you put it to ""Mode B"" The battery life is amazing on it too, I can even charge my phone from it when getting low while playing VR games!!! Definitely get this controller for the Samsung Gear VR!!!","July 19, 2016",Geoffrey J.
cool,5.0,this game controller is awesome battery life is amazing I like how they have some ports on the back so you could charge your phone and your controller great finger exercise honestly because likes the right trigger and left are kinda stif and it is kinda tiring to hold it so it's like a finger workout but you would get use to it. you don't need the app if you want to use the app you could go to aptido and get the app there and battery life is so good like you don't need a charges the controller for like 3 or 4 days sorry not good at english,"November 2, 2020",Takabay
"Good quality, but laggy",3.0,"It's a good product, but I really regret buying this. The controller feels comfortable and it connected easily to my phone, but the moment I started playing a game I could feel massive amounts of input lag. I could play the game but the lag was just unbearable. I know input lag is common with these wireless controllers, but this was my first time using one and I just couldn't stand it.","September 8, 2020",James
Impressed,5.0,"I have only owned it for a few days, but so far so good! It's a solid build and does what you want it to do. When turn on, use ""B"" as ""A"" does not work. I didn't even install the app as suggested, just turned on the Bluetooth on my Samsung s9 and the connection was instant. Works great for Dungeon Hunter 5 :)","February 20, 2019",Ryan Crouse
Unfortunately it doesn't have USB-OTG support and the Bluetooth suffers from pretty bad delays even when it's right next to the ...,3.0,"The controller feels solid, and if I could I would actually use this on other consoles. Unfortunately it doesn't have USB-OTG support and the Bluetooth suffers from pretty bad delays even when it's right next to the device I'm using. The software appears to have been abandoned but if you REALLY need a full sized wireless Android gaming controller, this will do the job. Just keep in mind, it does have delay.","July 3, 2017",Kyle
Outdated Software that isn't compatible and won't be updated,2.0,"You can use this controller as a standard HID device, but the only reason why I would buy this over another controller is to use it with ""MOGA"" compatible games, to which you can't even get the app anymore and you have to download it off of a 3rd party website to even use it as an HID device. I don't know why this is still even being sold when MOGA isn't even a thing anymore.","October 13, 2018",Aaron
"Driver support non-existent, HID mode only half functional (triggers do not work). Cheaper controllers like BEBONCOOL better.",2.0,"When the cheaper BEBONCOOL controllers fully support all applications and do it for less money you know this controller is a bad deal. I've only given it two stars because the controller is legitimately very nice, which is why it's such a shame that the drivers are awful and nearly useless. It didn't matter what 3rd party apps I tried to use to get my S7 Edge to recognize the triggers, nothing worked. Get a BEBONCOOL instead, it may not be as nice (though still pretty decent build quality), but at least you know it'll work in all circumstances.","November 23, 2016",PersonBuyingStuff
Exactly what you want,5.0,"I was looking for a controller to use alongside my Gear VR headset. The options that Samsung recommends is either their controller, the Steel Series Stratus XL, or this one. This has the edge in my books. It is the size of a PC/console controller and is therefore comfortable. The flip to hold your phone comes in super handy when playing emulator games, etc. The fact you can charge your phone from it is a bonus, making it a 2-for-1 and handy for travelers who get bored in airports. None of the others have these mix of features. Drawbacks: for my taste it's a bit light and I wish it came in more colours. It doesn't fit comfortably in a pocket. Overall assessment - good quality, a has multiple uses, and is a bit cheaper than some alternatives.","June 28, 2016",navin Rai
The Moga app is meh at best. The documentation is also meh at best,3.0,"This is so mixed. It works well, when it works with a game. The Moga app is meh at best. The documentation is also meh at best. It holds the phone firmly, and the battery life is great. Charge times are fine. The build quality is mid range, but solid enough. I'm not a fan of the glossy plastic, and would have liked a more textured / softer grip, but ergonomics are also fine. I've had problems with mappings, and analogues behaving like digital pads. Overall it works, but requires some effort.","March 9, 2016",Evan Prentice
it's really sad. I'm better off taking a PS3 controller,2.0,"Not impressed really.  Finicky bluetooth connection that sometimes drops.  Tried relegating it to my shield tv for some multiplayer mayhem, and takes forever to connect, drops connection frequently...it's really sad. I'm better off taking a PS3 controller, connecting it wired to my Shield TV, and using it.  Works WAY better, and the usb connections I have are shoddy.","November 2, 2017",Canuckle
Great product !,5.0,"Amazing product honestly. I use it to play with my Gear VR and to play emulators on my S6. The clamp is big enough to accomodate my phone. Can't see any negatives with this gamepad. The only thing I would have preferred is to have AA batteries, because with eneloops they can be easily and rapidly swapped, but that's just me. Overall great product.","February 3, 2016",JF
A Mobile Gamer Must-have,5.0,"Feels remarkably close to an Xbox controller. The spring loaded triggers take some wearing into but still provide emense accuracy. While playing graphic heavy games such as Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto or Need for Speed, the controller doesn't quite give enough power to charge my LG G5 but rather keeps the phone at its current percentage. If the phone stays in standby the controller will charge your device.","December 24, 2016",Jhevon
Stopped working.,1.0,"It worked fine the first time I switched it on, and during that time, it was a perfectly adequate controller, with good thumbsticks and analog controls which made my mobile racing games feel much better to play. Sadly, once I had turned it off, it would never turn back on again, no matter what I tried with recharging the battery. Only got one use out of it before it completely died and I returned it.","November 1, 2020",Jacinthe de-Chevigny
Was good when it worked,1.0,"But like many people report, this has issues with the left stick reporting and up/right pull constantly. Makes the controller unusable. Company does not reply to warranty requests.","September 25, 2019",Jose Fernandez de Castro
"Good build, easy to use, worked with several apps with no set up",5.0,Great product. Controller has a good weight to it. Build quality is good and feels great. Basically no set up required. Battery lasts a long time and chargers my phone well. I used to to play a ROM of Pokemon diamond with the DraStic Gameboy DS emulator and it worked perfectly. Also used it the FF9 android app and it worked perfectly including the joysticks. Took a few minutes to remap the controls in the game but had worked great since. Would highly reccomend.,"July 17, 2018",TeeJay
Fantastic product.,5.0,"I love the idea that the mount for the phone can be folded in when not in use, for playing on a Android TV or tablet when not mounted. The build quality is feels really good,  and the ability to charge your phone while playing is just amazing. This is easily the best Android Controller I've used.  I highly recommend it to others.","May 28, 2016",Tom
The best Bluetooth controller.,5.0,"It's a great Bluetooth controller l if you do any mobile gaming. The incontroller phone holder is very strong. It's easy to sync. It's got some uncomfortable hard edges, but I still love it.","October 21, 2017",FreakishOneYT
Button sticking after moderate use; unfit for serious play,1.0,"Y button sticking after a few hundred hours. Not unusable, but makes precision play frustrating, and I just decide not to play instead. Dual connection mode system is confusing to boot. All in all, unimpressed.","January 15, 2019",Matt

Fun to use but all in all in A HEADACHE,4.0,I like this controller.... The only thing that sucks is the company MOGA is no longer in business and the L2/R2 bumper pads tend to come apart inside the controller....

Great for Gear VR,5.0,I bought this controller to use with my samsung gear vr. After some research it seemed this was defintley one of the best options out there for it and although I came across the occasional forum where someone was comlaining of compatibility issues I've never had any such issues myself. If you do intend to use it for the gear vr always have the controller in its B mode setting as the A mode setting is intended for moga pro games and usually wont work.

,,"These shoes are very comfortable. I bought them before a trip to NYC, where I do a lot of walking. I only had 1 day to break them in, and I was concerned they'd be uncomfortable after a few hours on my feet. I was very pleased that my feet were fine every day I wore them. They have lots of cushion in the soles. Fit was as expected. I will update this if they show signs of poor durability, but so far they look like new. Update January 2020: I have had these shoes for more than 1 year now. I wear them to work about twice per week.  They look almost new.  Admittedly, I am in an office environment and I am sitting most of the day.  But I have had no complaints about durability.  And they are still very comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2018",Scott Simons
,,"Original review: I bought the correct size for my feet, but the when I get it, it feels the shoes are too small. After several days of using it, it expended to the right size. I guess I just need to loosen the shoe's materials. Update: 2018.09.30 I got the 7.5 M US last year. The first issue was when it was brand new, the shoes were really tight then eventually (may a week of wearing it) it would feel normal. The second problem is about ~9 to10 months of use, the shoes felt it was getting loose. It seems the threading is starting to break. If you step, in a wet ground (not a paddle), you can feel the water is getting into in the shoes. I will give it two stars because once you broke in and before the shoes starting to break, the shoes were comfortable to wear, but it does not last. I work in an office environment and I don't stand or walk a lot during the time I was using this pair of shoes.","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2018",quis

,,"The only thing good about these shoes is the ""look"". the only reason they got 2 stars. Everything else is poor. These shoes run large, are stiff, very uncomfortable. The other surprising and disappointing thing is that they have metal in the soles, and if you have TSA PRE, they must be removed at the airport screening. I travel weekly. I can put up with the stiffness, hoping they get better in time - but setting off TSA scanners when you walk through is unacceptable. Who makes shoes, in this day and age with air travel with metal in them? I travelled out with these, and will be 2 weeks away for business. Too much wear to return them. They'll be donated to Goodwill. If Dockers reads these posts - GET WITH THE TIMES.

I love playing! But it is the 3rd one I ...,1.0,"I would suggest NEVER BUY ANYTHING SMALL ELECTRICAL DEVICE FROM ""Hasbro Gaming'! They are the makers of this. I love playing! But it is the 3rd one I have owned in a matter of 10 years!!! I can't believe that they are not aware of selling this with a flaw. very quickly the far left button will act as if it has a mind of its own. When you ""Roll"", it will make a ""Hold"" for you. Or, when you ""Roll"", it will release the ""Hold"" that you already had there! SO CHEAP THAT THIS ONE STARTED BREAKING DOWN 3 DAYS AFTER IT WAS DELIVERED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe that after all these years they don't already know of this flaw.","June 16, 2018",Mr. Christopher Train

Love the game,5.0,"Love the game, I have bought from other retainers before and it always go missing like 2 weeks after I get it.

good for bud,5.0,I live in Canada..so yes..I grow a plant or two..this works good for 1 plant start to finish but would recommend you get 2 lights as I did and two plants did really nice at 3 months I got avg. of  10 Oz.  From each plant with good soil and bloom nutrients added,"October 20, 2018",Chris
Works great.,5.0,"I started my tomatoes and peppers for my garden under this light. They are such a dark shade of green and so healthy, I’m really impressed. It easily has a footprint large enough for the 150 seedings I use it for. My plants look way better than the ones I usually buy from a greenhouse. It also runs cool and quiet.","March 18, 2018",Paul B Mackenzie
Great lights for the money.,5.0,Bought two of these lights cost me over 400 dollars. Both ended up being defective. Contacted bestva and they sent me 2 newer units very quickly and they work amazing. My plants love them. Highly recommend.,"June 2, 2018",Neil MacKinnon
Good for Vegging!!,5.0,This light is good for vegging. I have had it for a year. It still works.,"December 12, 2018",Hondo
Very happy with This,5.0,"Very happy with This! Just finished setting up last night. Light is great quality, nice and sturdy frame. Installation was super easy, just basically removed my old energy eating light and hung the new led light. Pretty excited about the energy savings. Light should pay for it self fairly quick. Keep our peppers growing all year long!","January 11, 2018",Ernest
Really astoundingly bright.,5.0,This is my second one. Very pleased. I’ve bloomed high light orchids (vandas and cattleya) and have had to move my cactus further away because the light was so intense 2+’ away that they were getting pink pigment. To say I am pleased is an understatement. I also have a 3’ wide and tall medicinal plant that is so dense and happy growing under it that I’m just about to order a third for side light in flowering as the plant is so dense there is no way light from above will penetrate very far. What a great light! Stays cool with fan. No issues.,"September 21, 2018",Bob Ross
Amazing LED grow lights for the price!,5.0,I own 4 of these grow lights and i must say they work great! No issues at all i really suggest them i have grown from seed to finish with them and got 2.5 ounce on a short time vegged cannabis plant! *Legal in Canada keep that in mind! If i veg longer i know i can get more close to 3-4 ounces per plant with these lights...Now i also use them for cloning and work amazing!! As you can see this picture here is a clone of OG Kush and it is thriving in this light i highly recommend Bestva brand LED Grow lights and awesome owners. Thank you Bestva.,"March 15, 2019",Brad
Works as intended,5.0,"I really like the light. Like the chart in the instructions where it explains that 1000W LED replaces 600W HPS. I grow my parsley, chives, rosemary and sweet basil indoors over the winter. I have one 1000W and one 300W lights and plants seem to like it. 16 hour overnight and small fan oscillating. Great for cooking. Package came fine and everything what was promised was there. But cannot wait for the spring to move everything outside. Happy growing everyone :D","December 8, 2018",Martin

Bestva Led Grow LIgts - Best Grow lights Ever!,5.0,"Bestva 1000W led grow lights are the best! This is my first time growing my own plants indoor, (I am really a newbie at this). I started my seeds two weeks ago and the seedlings are loving the lights and doing fantastic. At first, I was not so sure as to what kind of lights to pick (as there are so many choices) but I'm sure glad I picked these ones. Not only they come with three years warranty but also 30 days worry free return guarantee and also the price is right! What else can I ask for? I bought two grow lights  and ordered two more (on their way). I can hardly wait for the end result. ....","October 26, 2018",Leny S
Good system.,5.0,"This doesn’t come with a timer. It’s a good light. It’s heavy. The switches and construction are sturdy. The fan noise is noticeable. You’d likely be bothered by it if you had to hear it constantly. The light coverage is quite wide, easily covering a 1 x 2 m table top. My seeds responded well and almost all germinated. I recommend this lighting system.","May 18, 2020",Mike B
Pretty happy overall.,4.0,"EDIT: this company has amazing customer service! And after a month of using this light my garden is loving it and very very healthy! Arrived very fast, a day ahead of expected arrival! Product as described and very solid. Not a fan of the hanging hook supplied, Not adjustable and hook looks weak for the weight.. Also 1 and only 1 bulb is not working upon arrival and set up. Not thrilled but can't complain much about 1 light bulb out of 100. First try with LED so hope all goes well. Super bright btw.","October 15, 2017",Sean
satisfied - follow-up 2019/01/16,2.0,"Seems to work fine with minimal heat. However, I have not used it through a complete grow cycle, so cannot comment on results. 2019/01/16 - after using this for a couple months, I am skeptical of its value. Compared to my friends LED grow light, this one appears to be a lot more ""blue"" and I question it's suitability for flowering. Also, I bought a quantum PAR meter and the test results are not impressive. I compared it to an HPS grow light and there really is no comparison. The HPS light has much more light power and much more coverage. I already had purchased two BestVA LED lights and I returned the one I could. I'm going with HPS and MH instead.","November 27, 2018",GA
"Good value and performance, but watch out for leaf burn",4.0,"This is a REALLY bright light that seems to be well made and well designed.  The ratio of blue/red/UV and IR bulbs makes good sense based on the research that I've done, and my plants have done well in both vegetative and flowering stages.  The 10w equivalent LEDs are super bright though, and although the light itself runs cool as ice with excellent (and quiet) ventilation fans, it will scorch your plants if you put them too close.  The manual suggests 30"" but I would keep young plants even further away than this and monitor them carefully.  Once you sort out that one detail though, this is a great light.","January 1, 2019",Amazon Customer
BLOOM SETTING FAILS,1.0,"Purchased the light and was excited to use it. When I initially turned it on I remember thinking it's seems slightly blue but figured it's brand new and the LEDs look active. Fast forward 4 weeks after turning it on and I noticed the light was now mostly just blue, put on my glasses and saw only 40% of the LEDs were active. Tried cycling the light from full spectrum to veg, no change, from veg to bloom and no LEDs would turn on. When my light was turned into bloom it would not work at all. So my full spectrum was failing and became a veg only light.","January 3, 2020",Zombrie
Impressive Customer Service.,5.0,"I have to give high marks to this companies customer service department. I bought 2 of these 1000 watt lights 1 year ago. About 1 month ago the red lights of one of the lights started flashing on and off constantly. I contacted the company and explained situation. We exchanged a few emails and 2 days after I gave them my address, a replacement light was at my door. The replacement light was also an upgrade that has the veg/bloom switches. Thank you for a grief free replacement process... unlike some other idiots I am currently dealing with. I find the foot print claim of 4.7 x 5.1 feet a little excessive as I am running 2 of these lights in a 5 x 6 space at approx. 18 inches from the plants.","October 8, 2019",Allan
good product. Actual watt draw,5.0,"Still strong with daily use, good product. Actual watt draw 185","May 24, 2017",Anthony
Good or bad light ???,1.0,This is more a question then a review but I have recently purchased two off these 1000 watt lights and I have two completely different light outputs one is 80 percent blue light and 20 percent red and the other light is the complete opposite 80 red and 20 blue not sure if I have a problem or different lights or the quality is just so variable with this product ??????,"February 26, 2019",Mar car
Incredible Plant Growth! (Photos included),5.0,"I specifically did not want to write a review the moment I turned the lights on because I wanted to see plant growth before submitting a review. This is a plant light and it will only be successful if it grows plants well. After a month of using this light, it blew me away! The growth my plants put on were absolutely ridiculous, much healthier and faster than I would think. I bought this light as my 2 year old avocado was losing its leaves due to low light (I live in Canada). It nearly died but it put on new growth (seen in the photos above) in just a few weeks! The leaves are so incredibly healthy looking too. I have the top of the plant off set from the center of the light as the light is so bright, it was burning some old leaves. Similarly, I sprouted an acorn indoors and had it under some very old incandescent lights. Moving it to the LEDs, it took off like a rocket! When my plants get bigger and I need more horizontal light, I'll be sure to pick another one of these up!","December 12, 2019",Jason
Killing my plant .,4.0,After setting the light up and placing the plant under it I am pretty pissed off to see that my plant is burning / shriveling up  ...  Will it recover ?  WTFF !!!  I am letting it have one more day ..  The plant was beautiful under t5 florescent lights. .  I did move the light up as far as I could and the plant recovered and turned out ok ... Some literature with tips or advice for using this light would be helpful ..  There was nothing like that in the box  ..  The only think that annoys me now is to see that I spent more for it than most people seem to be now ..,"February 22, 2020",jeff h.
it works,2.0,for the price its an okay light but I wouldn't recommend it. the bloom switch on mine sticks on and off and the fans in the light don't work. I tried to return it but it was just sent back to me so I just settled and set it up anyways with a fan above it for ventilation. my plants took to it very well and seem to be growing okay but overall im a little disappointed.,"July 25, 2020",JC
Look elsewhere...,1.0,"Don't do what I did. Don't buy this light. You can spend a little more money and get 1 light to flower a 3x3. This light will not. It's decent for veg or to maintain 18hrs for a mother plant. As well, I haven't even had it a year and LEDs are burning out. Those aren't the IR LEDs in the pic. They're burnt out LEDs. Cheap cheap cheap.","February 7, 2019",Chris
Great support for this product,5.0,I was using the product for a couple of weeks when I noticed a few Leds had gone out. I sent an email to support with a couple of pictures and they sent me a replacement right away. Even with a few rows of LEDS not working my plants were healthy and strong and growing.  I recommend this product and vendor. Excellent customer service. Update the replacement is going strong no complaints excellent service,"September 1, 2018",Amazon Customer
"Bright, Plants are happy..A little noisy",4.0,"Have been using this for the last month and a half, and my plants seem pretty happy, the hanger was a little too low for a 2 x 2 x 4 tent, and caused some light burn. My only problem (barely a problem) is the cooling fans are a little noisy, and run consistently. If your grow space is aiming for stealth, this isn't the light for you.","February 7, 2020",David b
Great Value,5.0,Lights showed up only a couple days later. Was first surprised at how small and compact it was but upon plugging it in the light blew me away. very powerful and efficient. After about a a week My Plants have responded very well and I look forward to using it right up to harvest.  Amazing quality for the price and the customer service seems great. Will update with any issues but so far so great.,"December 17, 2018",kiel
kept cool and they all grew very strong,5.0,"Used this to keep my tomato seedlings going in the spring.  Installed under the stairs, kept cool and they all grew very strong.  Also used for herbs and lettuce after, same results.  Will probably buy a second one next year.","June 5, 2018",Christina
Not Impressed already have burnt Led and No customer service at all !!,5.0,They worked great for my first run for vegetative phase I had 2 over 4 plants in a 4*8*8 tent. Flowering I had to throw in the old 600w hps and take these out just wasn't getting the density I should have been getting (wasn't expecting to to be honest). The in my second run I lost 9 leds in one and 8 leds in the other. tried emailed the company just for a replacement led board and still no response. I have tried to remove on of the leds to replace them and its not very easy to get the old one off. I will be able to get them repaired fairly cheaply my self but don't think they should have failed within the first 2000hrs of use. Do your self a favor if you are looking to buy a cheaper led light get something cob style at least if it breaks its not hard to replace the Cob led No customer service what so ever just keep that in mind if your thinking of buying one Update: this store owner has reached out and replaced the leds free of charge,"April 25, 2019",justin provencal
Great value for money,4.0,So far so hood. urchaswd 1 month ago and love this light. Especially for the price point you cannot go wrong. I grow everything from herbs to vegetables and marijuana and it matters not what you use ot for it works grwat. The dual chip for veg and flower is also extremely dy.  In fact i purchased the same light this morning (1200watt instead of 1000 ) because how much i love it. Good deal great value for money.  Actual pull os smaller than expected though so if your growing pot you may need to get higher wattage or an additional light .( hence my second light). Thanks bestVA.,"May 20, 2020",Dan Smith

If I have problems with it I will post them here.","December 17, 2018",Amazon Customer
"If your stuck on a budget, this light will not disappoint I'm very happy with my purchase",5.0,"This light is great, very bright, great footprint for the price, combined this 1000w with my two 300ws and my 5x5x7 tent is eye straining without safety glasses, my plants are loving the new light and I'm loving the lack of heat this light puts out, very easy to work with.","August 4, 2018",Chelsy Smith
Burnt bulbs,1.0,So have had two of these lights for about 9months they worked great but this last week I noticed the light was a little different so I took them down and inspected one has 15 burnt bulbs and the has 6 burnt bulbs waiting to hear back from bestva right now I'll give two stars for now will see if bestva fixes this Have now messaged bestva 3 times with no response getting pretty upset now what good is a 3 year warranty if you cant get ahold of anyone at the company not sure what to do at this point feel like I threw 300 dollars away,"January 21, 2019",Sean Soviskov

Excellent system and powerfull,5.0,Very good light.. super bright but it is a shock to your existing plants be aware.. alternate with a sodium or noen light to get them used to this spectrum. That is my experience so far but love the setup. I will definitely buy the 2000w after! Aslo to mention that it does produce quite some heat so dont put your plants too close.,"April 5, 2020",Amazon Customer
A Great Choice!,5.0,"It's very simple to set up. Out of the box, onto the adjustable hanger...done! The Veg and Bloom switches are clearly marked. The unit is very light, so its weight also makes it essy to install. It cannot be connected in a seies, but for me, this isn't a problem. So, quick and easy setup, clearly marked switches, and an excellent value overall.","September 16, 2019",Bill

Great lamp for the price,5.0,I bought the previous version of this lamp in 2018. Only one switch for both veg and bloom. The lamp literally burnt my plants. The newest version has 2 separate switches for veg and bloom and it is a big improvement. My plants love it.,"July 14, 2019",Amazon Customer

Solid unit,4.0,"It's only been in use a couple of weeks now but so far so good. As for longevity; time will tell but is seems to be a solid product and the warranty is one of the best as far as I can tell.

solid. easy to use.,4.0,"It definitely met my expectations for quality and construction and ease of use.

No regrets, but I haven't owned it long.","August 1, 2019",kent hall
Works well,4.0,"The light works as intended, it’s on the bluer side of the spectrum compared to others LEDs I’m running. The fan is a bit loud and the light gives off a fair bit of heat.

Good for price but not great if you want big plants,3.0,Purchased two of these sets. Not the best lights but you get what you pay for.

Eau de perfume has a higher content perfume oil and sells for a higher price per ounce.

"A great fit for your budget, style and electronics+ storage needs!",5.0,"Needed an electronics organization bag that holds all of my needed cabling and devices on the go. This holds 95% of what I needed it to do, excluding a Bluetooth speaker that is too tall but will fit if you squeeze it in. The three separate storage areas are very versatile and I was pleased with how much I could fit and customize the bottom dividers. I even found room for my Xbox controller with the connected attachment to have its own spot! I would not recommend it for your tablet to go in if you are storing other components with hard or sharp edges. Quality materials I can see lasting a number of years. It is a decent weight with semi-firm walls. It is waterproof for spills and rain on the exterior. The colour is pleasing to the eye as well as the quality of zippers. Having dual zippers on both is a useful feature for ease of access. This is a great value for what you get. The size is easy enough to fit into a backpack or luggage but too big for an average size purse, for reference. My next purchase would only be for something larger with a hard case but that may be venturing into the next price and size category. An excellent fit for your budget, style and electronics+ storage needs!","August 11, 2020",Paul Magruder
Perfect size for a large battery pack,5.0,"I've been struggling to find a case for my 50 000 mAh battery ( https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01BLXY3B6 ), but this case fits perfectly. Plenty of room for the battery pack, its charger, charging tips and cables. The dividers are velcro, so I just stuck them to the inside of the main compartment along the perimeter and it's still a very nice fit. Could fit a few more cables in the top compartment as well - maybe a small travel USB charger. Fully packed with my battery pack, it's a little large for every-day-carry; but if you knew you were going somewhere you'd need it, the carrying handle makes it an afterthought to grab and toss in the car. Too big for EDC, but very portable, we'll say.","December 22, 2019",Amazon Customer
Definitely Worth The Price,5.0,"I initially meant to order something else but kept this one in my order by mistake. However, after receiving the organizer (within 10 hours of placing my order) my mistake turned out to be a blessing. This bag is has endless uses for anyone who likes to keep anything neatly organized such as daily essentials (wallet keys, hand sanitizer, portable phone charger, multitool) or specific tools like (voltage testers with the appropriate accessories)","February 24, 2019",Ian
"Lots of space, adequate padding.",5.0,"I purchased this case to transport my RPi, wireless Rii keyboard, and various cables. The case is probably much lager than I need. It holds the RPi, keyboard, power adapter, a 6' hdmi cable, 8' 3.5mm audio cable, a couple of usb cables, and a usb wall wart. There's still plenty of room for more things!","October 19, 2018",Brandon D.
Very Cheap and Flimsy,1.0,"I've used something else from ProCase and love it, but this one was delivered completely smooshed. It was warped and the material was too soft to try and manipulate it back to it's regular form. Really cheap and flimsy in my experience (obviously) and I definitely do not recommend this particular product to anybody.","May 26, 2019",Tyler C.

,,"It is a shame that this product smells like petrolium because otherwise it is a well put together and thoughtfully designed product. Sadly it has that rubbey plasticy industrial smell which in my experience never comes out, and seeing as this will be travelling with me in a backpack i don't want to have to put up with this smell. If they can fix this it would have been a 5 star review.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 11, 2019",Amazon Customer

,,"I originally purchased this case for my tech gear but as soon as it arrived I knew this case was destined for greatness... Those of you that wear chunky wooden beads and quirky, unattractive brooches will know that it’s impossible to find travel cases for such treasures. Yet here it was, a case like no other, with room for both beads and brooches. My only problem was...where do I store my tech? The solution was clear, another case was ordered and the chaos of cables became a harmonious symphony of order. Now, if only the case came in different colours, I wouldn’t be pulling out my precious jewels in business meetings when scrambling for my travel mouse. #HintHint","Reviewed in Australia on July 26, 2019",NoHomeCook
,,"Acabo de sacar de varias cajas y cajones los distintos conectores, tarjetas de memoria, adaptadores, y demas aparataje auxiliar que tenia en diferentes cajas y cajones.

Así cuando salga de viaje o vaya a utilizarlos sé dónde están. De momento una compra acertada. He ocupado bastantes de los distintos departamentos apartados.

,,"I've been looking for many cases and often it's a lottery because you don't know how it'll work out until you can inspect it in your hands. This fabric case has plenty of storage for SD cards, thumbdrives, phones, wifi hotspots, cables, or headphones (if you can fold them flat). One compartment can fit a Samsung S10-sized phone, and another compartment will fit larger phones or tablets, around 8 inches I think. One compartment is configurable, you can modify the layout and sub-compartments by re-arranging the velcro dividers. Important to mention - the velcro dividers are quite sturdy and will prevent the case from being squashed. No, it won't protect you if someone stands on it or puts a 100-pound box on top of it, but it will survive most travel scenarios. This is something that wasn't mentioned in the product descriptions so it exceeded my expectations. Finally, I was extremely surprised to receive it within just a couple of days, this is unheard of in Western Australia, especially during the Xmas rush when the post is always delayed. I don't know how they pulled it off but props to the team for such speedy delivery.","Reviewed in Australia on December 18, 2019",Mac
,,"Ein halber Stern Abzug, weil die Netztasche im unteren Reissverschlussteil der Tasche etwas schief angenäht ist. Ansonsten bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dieser Tasche. Das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis stimmt. Ich habe meine diversen Kamera-, Handy-, Tablet-Kabel, Speichermedien, Ministativ, Powerbank und sonstigen Dinge alle schön übersichtlich verstaut und kann jetzt bei einer Reise einfach nur die Tasche greifen und habe alles dabei, was ich brauche. Das war das Ziel. Die Tasche ist (bis auf den einen Einsatz) sehr gut verarbeitet. Die Qualität der verarbeiteten Materialien (Obermaterial, Reissverschlüsse) verspricht eine lange Haltbarkeit. Für diesen günstigen Preis kann ich die Tasche uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen. Update: Einen chemischen Geruch konnte ich nicht feststellen. Riecht halt ein klein wenig neu, so wie andere Taschen und Koffer auch, aber nicht intensiv und nur wahrnehmbar, wenn man direkt mit der Nase rangeht.","Reviewed in Germany on May 28, 2019",Kathrin S.

Nello spazio non delimitato da cerniere ma dalle fascette a strappo( che reggono bene) ci ho potuto inserire il mio speaker bluetooth e un paio di caricatori. Le cerniere di chiusura della valigia sembrano molto resistenti e permettono di portarla comodamente a giro senza rischi di dispersione cavi.

,,"J'ai reçu cette sacoche semi-rigide aujourd'hui, elle était assez froissée et tout aplatie à l'ouverture du colis. Cependant, elle a repris de la forme après l'avoir rempli. Combiné à un système de velcro, j'ai pu y ranger et organiser mes câbles qui étaient à l'origine fourrés dans un tiroir. Mais la taille de la sacoche n'est malgré tout pas suffisante pour tout ce que j'ai à ranger. Je pense donc en effet qu'elle est surtout faite pour voyager et préserver temporairement son matériel plutôt que de stocker en  grande quantité. Niveau qualité, la sacoche semble assez solide, mais je trouve  que les coutures assez irrégulières, cela n'a pas l'aire de poser de problème sur sa solidité, mais peut être qu'il pourrait y avoir quelque points faibles dans sa résistance. Je trouve que les fermetures sont assez bien travaillées et ne laisse pas présager de futurs problèmes de fermeture. Question esthétique, le tissu est assez joli mais parait salissant. Et la forme générale de la sacoche qui se voudrait carré finit en réalité avec un aspect assez ""patatoïde"". Mais ces critère sont largement négligeables pour la fonction principale de ce produit.

Best Travel Cable/Charger Storage Bag,5.0,"BAGSMART makes some very nice, well thought out products & this one is not an exception. This particular size is ideal for traveling. If you are looking for cable storage/organizer for your home then get the larger size. This one has 7 cable pockets, 5 of which are sized for usb charging cables while 2 are big enough to store larger chargers (like laptop/Nintendo switch) & Ethernet cables. Then there are 3 dedicated pockets for sim card and memory card storage. And many other zipper pockets for storing other necessary traveling stuff like travel plugs & sockets. The only thing that could have made this is even better will be including an additional pocket on the outside of the bag so the more frequently used cable will be readily accessible or maybe a phone sized pocket on the outside so you can quickly stick your phone in there while going through airport security. Overall, a very nice product & in my opinion a must have for every family.","October 14, 2019",FT
Good storage - solid construction - don't like the big logo,5.0,"Good storage unit. It's small enough to go into my day bag and wrap up all my electronic junk that always bothered me. My only complaint is that there is a big obvious logo tag on the outside of the unit advertising that there are electronics inside. I travel a bit overseas, so I like being discrete about what I own so it's a bit of a negative to have a big label you can't remove on the outside of your storage case. It's not like I have much to have stolen but I've also learned that once you start showing labels, logos and images of what look like important electronics or expensive equipment, then you set yourself up as a target. Otherwise, the storage unit is great, I like it and it does what I need it to do ... it feels strong, zipper feels solid and the storage spaces and tie downs work great.","January 24, 2018",S Katak
Netting Issue.  Company went beyond to correct the problem.  Wow.,5.0,"The netting that holds usb drives had torn from the elastic-type band that keep it in place.  The size is the pouch is exactly as I had imagined it. EDIT: The company went to great lengths to sort out this problem for me.  The gesture of reaching out to me on its own is enough to give them 5 stars, let alone the fix that was done to correct the problem.  If I had a need for more products like this, I'd be happy to continue being their customer.  Great job, Bagsmart!  I really appreciate it.  :)","March 5, 2017",Keith A.
Well made product,4.0,"This case serves its purpose and holds all my chargers and adapters for travelling.  I bought the blue version so I can find it easily in my suitcase and in darkened hotel rooms.  I only rated it four starts because I feel it is larger than it needs to be.  Having said this, the larger size makes it easier to organize and find the individual cables and adapters.  The case is 7.5 inches by 10 inches.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a pocket on the outside for easy access for phone or the most commonly used charger.","March 5, 2017",Loban
Very handy,5.0,"Great if you're an average packer with average cord needs.  If you're a photographer or have a ton of cords, maybe a little small.  I managed to pack the following: 3 phone cords, 2 plug-ins, an international travel adapter, vape batteries and charger, a GoPro and charger, headphones, 3 plug block and an extra power cord.  It stayed fairly low profile and could easily accommodate 2 people.","December 1, 2018",Julian
Super lightweight and top notch quality and design,5.0,Super lightweight and top notch quality and design. Keeps my cords and plugs organized and neatly placed in my bag everywhere I go. Compartments are just enough to hold plugs and garters to keep the cords from tangling. The USB pockets and other compartments are made of mesh so you can easily see what's inside without having to open it all the time. Zippers are smooth and sturdy enough to hold everything inside without having a hard time opening and closing it even if it's fully packed. Highly recommended!,"May 22, 2018",Gino
quarter pounder charger bag,4.0,This is a great sized bag for carrying all your cables and adapters that you would need for travel or simply having it to organize. It fits many different wires and materials. I found no issue with sliding regular rubber cables or braided cables in between each compartment. Plenty of space for you to bring what you need to keep everything neat and tidy. The bag itself is made of a decent material. It's soft but able to hold a lot of electronics inside. Even with the bag bulging somewhat the zippers still close and hold without bursting. Be careful to stick robust items with corners like credit card sized chargers in the bigger slots as sometimes this makes the liner on the inside tear but is easily repaired with some glue or sewing.,"September 14, 2018",cyrusrivers
Slim profile perfect for travel,5.0,"I have a couple different pouches for various dongles, adapters and cables. This one does not fit as much, but it's slim profile is perfect for day to day use, and I keep my most frequently used accessories in it. The outer zippers open around far enough that the whole bag can lie flat on the table, allowing for ease of access to all pockets and pouches. There is only one inner pocket with a zipper. I wish the other inner mesh pocket also had a zipper, as small accessories do fall out whenever you open up the bag.","April 17, 2020",Ken K
Holds all my stuff in one place!,5.0,"This is a pretty good, medium-sized electronics holder. I wanted something to hold my little cables and external hard drives all in one place without being too bulky. This is perfect for that! If you’re looking for a travel case that is sturdy, this isn’t it though. The case itself is pretty flimsy so don’t except it to protect anything if you drop it. All in all, it was what I was looking for and is very useful. Only thing that bugs my is the plastic on the micro card slots and the front - super unnecessary and hard to get off. Even after picking at it with my nails, I couldn’t get it all off. Not that important, just a bit annoying and unnecessary in my opinion.","June 12, 2019",canadiangirl13
Very Good for Travelling and organizing  electronic accessories,4.0,"This electronic accessory organizer bag is lightweight and compact. It held my cords, charger and camera charger and extra batteries. I would have liked just a little more expansion to the elastic slots for cords as it is a little fiddle to get them slipped under. Also a couple cm more in overall expansion of the bag to allow larger chargers to fit more easily. Durable and appears well made.","August 28, 2019",Debs
Fits so much stuff!,5.0,"Last year, I purchased a cable/electronics organizer case from AmazonBasics and although it was great quality, it was waaay too bulky. I was in the market for a thin and portable organizer and saw that this one had great reviews. It's totally perfect. Has lots of little compartments and even holds my external hard drive. Really happy with it!","July 22, 2017",czechyourself
worth buying,4.0,"I like this bag for keeping everything together. Its built well and feels good quality. but I have some ideas that might make it better. For someone with cables that are braided it can be hard to slide them through, cables that are thicker or braided are harder but my earbuds and micro usb cable for my powerbank fit fine. If they made it a little bigger for some cables or had one or two a bit bigger. also there is three pockets for sd cards. If you carry a camera its a smart idea but it would be better if there was just two one for sd and micro sd. Or maybe a pouch on top for sd cards or coins. I like it because it can hold my 5s you might be able to fit a 6 with no case. it can also hold usb ac adapters i can hold two apple ones and one with two ports i got off amazon. this bag is amazing for carrying everything when traveling but i thinks it more for putting in a bag. i would be nice if they added something to carry it like a Velcro handle that goes over the zipper, it would make holding it easier. But besides somethings that could be added to make it better its a good quality bag a you can add a lot of different things which is nice but it cant hold an tablet or ipad. 9/10","July 15, 2017",SKL
"Per initial handling, looks and feels good.",4.0,"I just received this and will be using it when i travel in 10 days - but it seems like it would do the job exactly as described by the seller. I am keen to see how much of my stuff it will take, shouldn't be a major issue. A little concerned about long term quality when it comes to the fabric netting and internal zippers, only time will tell.","October 1, 2019",Label J
Good Organizer,4.0,"Using this primarily for travelling and it is helpful to have the cables and associated hardware sorted out. This allows quick & easy access and use also cable tangles avoids tangles. The variety of storage methods within the case will accommodate most cables, charging and storage devices.  Pleased with the functionality of the case.","January 31, 2020",Mooselander
LOOKS GOOD - FEELS GOOD TOO,5.0,"It looks like a very nice case with solid zippers. I've looked at it and touched it so far - feels nice. Looks tiny, but I hope it delivers on its promise of being sturdy. The blue colour will stand out inside a crowded backpack. While I have yet to travel with this item it looks like it will do the job and I look forward to organizing all of my tiny cords, power dealies, and plug thingies into this pleasant looking case. The idea of having my electrical cords etc. take up less space than the ' let's dump it all in this  larger sack' I typically use for travelling - well, that appeals to me.","June 17, 2020",LowercaseD
good quality for price but their slim bag is a better option if weight is a concern,3.0,"i ordered a bunch of these to compare weight, and features. This Bagsmart weighs 140 grams and has good organization for a good price, although i would recommend their slim bag as that is 1/3 lighter and offers the same features but only if your luggage has wheels. My carry on bag is not on wheels so every gram counts which is why i am returning it. I ended up going with a MEC bag that, although not as good for organization, comes in at 65 grams. Last thing i want is for any bag/packing cube that i use, to be heavier than the actual stuff i carry!","January 15, 2019",Lawrenceliketheriver
Lilliputian Power Cord Case,3.0,"It's convenient to have your stuff all in one place, but not all of your stuff can fit in here.  It doesn't hold quite as much as the picture would make you think -- looks can be deceiving.  This may be more suited to a miniature world where everything is smaller than in real life.  But the organizer in me thought that I should give it a try.","December 16, 2016",TEGS
One Place for all my gadgets and cables!,5.0,"I finally had a bag to hold all my electronic accessories while I travelled. It fit in my travel purse and I was amazed how much I was able to fit in the bag.  The bag material is sturdy and I was very happy with the design. Now I have everything in one spot ready to go anytime I am off on a holiday, long or short.  I would recommend this bag for your electronics.","March 15, 2019",Lovetobuybooks
Perfect for keeping all electronic cords together.,5.0,Great product.....durable and well made. It has tons of space for all your cords headphones and pockets for everything. I was able to keep everything neat and tidy as I was using a plastic bag and elastics for the same purpose. Love the color too as it matches my tote bag. My daughter thought it was going to be too big but she says its the perfect size so I bought her one too. For the price it is a smokin deal!,"September 1, 2019",Suzy-Q
Nice compact case for travel,4.0,"Nice small kit to take for travelling.  The only improvement I would see is giving it a bit more slack to increase vertically in height - perhaps just a bit more material where the zippers are so cables and power adapters have an easier time fitting it.  They do fit, just that you need to make sure they are compacted to get inside the zippered pockets. Time will tell if the mesh holds, but no problems so far.","February 14, 2017",Gus Chan
Great organization tool.,5.0,"I bought two of these - one for my camera bag to organize chargers, cables, etc. and one for electronic cables and chargers when travelling.  My only regret is that I bought the small ones, but that is my bad, not the companies fault!!  The bag is well laid out, lots of compartments and feels pretty sturdy. Absolutely recommend (but buy the bigger one!!)","March 13, 2019",Amazon Customer
Perfect for travel,5.0,"I love the fact that this pouch has pockets as well as straps.  I considered buying the flat piece that was interlocking straps, but I thought that prongs etc. could maybe hitch up on other items and I wanted a smaller overall size.  This bag works perfectly.  It is deep enough to hold my battery recharger, wall plugs, bluetooth headphones and various cords and still remains only 2.5 inches thick.  Easy to carry in one hand.","August 18, 2018",Kajury
Don’t WASTE Your Money / AVOID Like The Plague,1.0,Don’t WASTE Your Money This thing is too small to hold anything. Even a basic iphone cable doesn’t fit under the elastic band.

better than the plastic bag that I was using,5.0,"Solid product. a bit more plastic covering the logos and whatnot than I like but it lets the consumer know that the company care about their products; they even give you a quality translucent ziplock bag for your bag! it's soft shell so it does flop a bit but once things are placed within, it's pretty sturdy and more rigid.","July 14, 2019",Brian C
Great organisation solution for on the go,5.0,"Excellent product to keep all off my cables, chargers, and usb keys. I also use it to keep pens, spare change, lens cloth and a small pair of scissors. I like that i can open it and see what i have at one glance than having to look through our dump out a pouch. It's a good size to throw into my everyday backpack. I can't do without it.","January 20, 2017",Will Wong
Measurements are a little off,4.0,"So I bought this bag mostly to fit a large capacity battery pack. I double and triple checked the measurements for the pack to fit in this case. And it doesn’t fit. I can still use it with a smaller capacity pack, and it does work for the cable I need to bring with me for work.","March 28, 2019",Stephany Steele
Love it! It helps me stay organized and know where everything is!,5.0,"Do you know the best way to tie a knot??? Put all your cords and headphones in a ziplock bag for a few minutes and when you go to reach for the cords they will be perfectly knotted up!  But now with my BagSmart, everything is organized, nothing is knotted up and I don't spend half my flight trying to un-tie my headphone!  I had it at my last meeting and my two coworkers sitting on either side of me saw the bag and were so impressed by it they ordered their own right there on the spot!  If you want to stay organized I highly recommend this bag.","March 19, 2019",Barbara

Not exactly what I required but the fault is my ...,4.0,"Not exactly what I required but the fault is my own.  I was hoping for something a bit larger.  I have a lot of cords in my backpack and they tend to sit in the bottom.  I was hoping for something to spread the cords out vertically, something that would sit with the laptop in it's compartment.  (This makes it much easier to stow under an airplane seat.)  The bag I want needs to be twice as large and able to hold a laptop charger or two.  I didn't check the dimensions carefully and the item is exactly what I ordered (it is quite handy for the smaller items and cables and I have found it useful) but it isn't exactly what I wanted.","January 23, 2018",Mark Logan

Fantastic Case for Efficient Organization!,5.0,"Case has two separate compartments, with one side with pouches and cable holders, the other strictly cable holders. Does an extremely efficient job of storing cables in a compact form. Fantastic for travel! In my situation case managed to store all the cables that I had in a ;large box at the side of my desk.

"as advertised, but if you have a lot of two metre cords or thick battery packs get something larger",5.0,"As advertised, but if you have a lot of two metre cords or thick battery packs get something larger. one zipper separated already but went back to normal and seems to be staying that way - Be careful how much you stuff in it. It has lots of places for cords, but it is not big enough for two or three metre (6' to 10') USB cords in all of them.  Fine for a few cords, some memory chips, earbuds and a couple of thin battery banks, but don't expect to put a ten foot cord in every pocket, it really isn't that big, and it isn't that thick - consider the dimensions before choosing this one. Not unhappy. It could use a heavier zipper and a handle would be a nice feature, but overall it is what I asked for, and what I got. Good price. Would be good for lots of things other than USB cords, like Vape equipment, Pens pencils and ink cartridges, a small sketch pad, dry erase marker set if you are a teacher, small shave kit or maybe a makeup kit, small item tool kit, collection of fancy pens, or anything else you can think of.","August 14, 2019",Robert

Excellent for travelling,5.0,"I liked the build of the product as it seems to be constructed out of durable materials. I also like having 2 zippers per compartment, this is helpful if you tend to overstuff the compartments. The tablet sections hold a 7 or 8 inch tablet comfortably.

,,"I'm comparing these directly to the Howard Leight by Honeywell Impact Sport Sound Amplification Electronic Earmuff, Classic Green (R-01526) . Wins for the Walker's: 1. The control knob is easier to locate and operate while wearing the headset. That's not to say the Howard Leight set is difficult, just that the Walker's set has a larger, more pronounced knob. 2. The AUX input has a built in cover and is in a slightly superior orientation (towards the bottom of the headset and recessed). 3. The battery door is more obvious/easier to remove. Could be considered a negative, as the Howard Leight battery door has a more affirmative ""click"" when removing. I've not had an issue with either. 4. The headband is thicker and uses superior materials IMO. It uses a neoprene like material as opposed to a faux leather on the Howard Leight set. 5. Thicker pads on the ear cups that seem to seal slightly better. I wear glasses and I prefer the fit of the Walker's. Tight and light (bowchickawowow). 6. Built in mic has metal covers that are flush. The Howard Leight set has foam covers that protrude slightly. 7.The way the Walker's modify incoming sound seems more subtle and natural. The Howard Leight set has a pronounced change in volume. The Walker's also produce less chirping, static, and interference sounds. The advantage in overall ear protection is negligible. 8. The Walker's just look cooler by my taste. Angular and refined, hence the ""Razor"" name. 9. This is anecdotal at best, but I feel I can just throw the Walker's on with less initial adjustment. Wins for the Howard Leight: 1. Noticeably smaller profile while equipped and while folded up for storage. They fit well into a pocket or pack. The weight difference is negligible. 2. The wires from the headband to the ear cups are thicker, shorter, and have superior protection at the connection points. 3. The arms connecting the headband to the cups are ever so slightly beefier. Time will tell if that means stronger. 4. More distinct omni directional reporting. The Walker's are more like natural ears in that both sides hear a sound regardless of direction, but the Howard Leight set makes it way more obvious what direction it actually came from. Walker's are more natural, Howard Leight are more modified. 5. No giant grey brand logo on the headband. They just have a more subtle and traditional appearance. The Walker's are more aggressive stylistically. 6. On most days they are $10 to $20 lower in price without feeling noticeably cheaper. Note: I paid less for the Walker's due to a sale. I'm a marginally above average size male and have shared both sets with larger and smaller men as well as very small women. No one complained about either set, but I think the Walker's were more impressive to most. I believe it's very obvious that Walker's set out to match or exceed the Howard Leight earmuffs in all regards and were successful. If you're a range day tripper or hunter, I'd recommend the Walker's.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2017",BanHim!

,,"So far I've used these 5 times for Goose hunting and they work great; better than I had imagined. And, for ~$40 they are an excellent purchase/ value. However, similar to other reviews, the only negative thing that I have found is that you cannot hear or tell which direction a noise is coming from. All you can tell is that the noise is coming closer to you. Considering that I am using these primarily for duck/ goose hunting, it is a little challenging pin pointing which direction they are flying in from. My way around this is to rest them above my ears and then quickly more them over my ears once I visually see the birds flying in. With all this said, these are a very smart choice for hunters to save our, what, hearing...","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2020",Todd
,,"I wanted to like these, but caved and sent them back. I simply cannot use them for hunting. The band appears very durable; however, that causes excessive tension on my ears. The padding is simply empty rubber with air in it that gets expelled when they are attached to my head. Thus, no cushion at all. My ears still hurt from using them twice. In regards to sound, they appear to amplify close sounds, while muting distant sounds. Nearly impossible to hear deer walking in the distance. Furthermore, they have a constant white noise like rushing water of a shallow fast-running creek. Very distracting. In regards to hunting, the omni-directional microphones make hunting exceedingly difficult, as every sound sounds like it is in the middle of your head. You will spook deer turning your head trying to find where the sound is coming from. I didn't deduct points for this because it is clearly stated that they are not stereo, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. These ear muffs were supposed to be designed for hunting, hence the color and slim profile. Therefore, the manufacturer should go the distance and make them usable for hunting. My recommendation to people buying these is to purchase them only for sighting in your rifle outdoors if you spend 30 minutes or less doing it. You cannot wear them for more than 30 minutes without excessive ear pain and they are useless for hunting.","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2019",Rooster
,,"I’ve been using these for about six months now. Overall I’m impressed with the quality of the air muffs, they are robust, and have held up to a little abuse. I use these for listening to music and other media purposes as well as ear pro.  I did opt for customizing mine a little bit, and I will probably replace the OEM speakers with some higher quality speakers out of a regular set of studio headphones next, as well as replacing the speaker wire with the higher gauge studio quality wire and soldering that in place. I am also adding a 1/4” aux cable with 3.5mm adapters. I have gotten to adding patches and Velcro as well as the headband cover. Eventually I’ll replace the mics if necessary. May do an extended mic project. If I get into it like that I’ll throw it up on YouTube. I am hoping that by over-building this base product, I will have a stout set of ear pro muffs that will last me for many years","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2018",Happy Dad
,,"I'm used to shooting with in-ear protection (military) so having muffs took some adjustment, but I'm glad I made the switch.  On the range I can hear my spotter but don't go deaf shooting a 300 winmag, 338, or .50 BMG.  In the field hunting, they're a big help.  I have about some pretty significant hearing loss in my right ear, so I'm trying to keep what I have left.  These let me hear better than I can unaided in the timber (direction is a little tricky at first), but I'm protected when things go boom.  They work well enough that I bought an additional set for my girlfriend and I've had a couple buddies ask me for the link to buy their own after borrowing mine.","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2019",Sean E
,,Got these for my husbands birthday and he just raves about them every time he uses them. He wore them hunting and also to the gun range to a turkey shoot where there were at least 60 people shooting. The sound of the gun shoot didn't even hardly register in his ear yet he was able to hear even the quietest of conversations.  He said they would even make for great spy wear you can hear what people are saying from great distances. LOL He highly recommends these Walkers Game Ear Razor Slim ear muff's.

,,"These protectors are great! Used for 1st time at indoor range and could hear normal sounds very clearly while saving what's left of my hearing from the .45 in next lane. Some reviews mentioned the ""seal"" breaking around the pads but I didn't experience that. Like the flat compact size and folding capability. Way better than what I had. 1/12/18 update: had these over a year now and sadly my stars drop to three from five. The muffs function satisfactorily at in & outdoor ranges. Cancelling bangs works fine (tho not as good as older pair of non-electronic) and normal sounds/voices are heard very well. The ear pads are still somewhat stiff even after a year + use and tend to leak noise slightly. My main beef is with customer support! The plastic part that connects the muff assembly to the overhead wire broke and won’t hold the muff tightly to the ear. Called customer support Dec 20 and spent about 45 min ordering replacement part ($12 user install). Recalled support again Jan 10 and they informed me they were out of stock and no estimated restock or shipping date. These parts must break a lot if Walkers is out of stock so should be a manufacturing defect and repaired or part replaced free in my opinion. Almost a month w/o use and counting...","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2016",KKor3216

,,"I think for the price... I like it. It will do what is designed. I noticed when I clap with the headset on, I can't hear the actual clap but I can hear it via the microphone. This is good. I'll try lawn mower or weed wacker this weekend to see how applicable it might be for use other than just the range. I am pretty hopeful.

,,"These muffs are amazing. Hunters, shooters, anti-noise lover, or sound lover, these ear muff are for you. As a shooter, there is a volume switch that you can turn up so you can talk, and hear the person next to you, or 50' away, but instantly shut off when you fire your weapon. Amazing. I am wearing them today to listen to birds singing, chicken clucks, or now, my neighbors talking. If you turn the volume switch to off, silence. No, I mean nothing. Looking for muffs for total sound protection on a plane, baby crying, the talker next to you? These muffs are it.

,,"I purchased these for my nights at the shooting range and am not at all disappointed. They fit great even with earrings, ballcap and ear protection and are comfortable. The volume adjust comes in handy for range instruction. I can hear the range master (and other background noise) very clearly and all sound deadens when loud noises (such as gunfire) is picked up. Would be handy to have around the house for family members who can't quite hear the tv at lower volumes OR if you want to eavesdrop on conversations nearby. Everyone can see that your wearing earphones but probably have no idea that you can hear their conversations clearly. (teeheehee) They do get sweaty after awhile but wipe clean with a wet wipe.

,,"I absolutely love these muffs. I have 3 pairs for my two kids and I. They are a must have for kids on the range. Normal muffs require you to speak louder or yell for others to hear you, especially on the range but these don’t require that. You can talk in a normal voice and they’ll hear every word. It amplifies all sounds then immediately mutes when you fire a shot. There is also a volume control. They are compact, comfortable and come in several colors for everyone in the house. I highly recommend these muffs.","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2018",Amazon Customer

And see if that helps. Use them for yote hunting in N.D. and SD so it’s always windy. The second thing is the rubber seal for the headphone jack won’t stay in and just hangs down.. not a big deal but can be annoying when turning my head with a heavy jacket with hood.","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2017",We The People

,,"Great fit...even with a fat head!  They amplify a great deal to hear others speak but at the same time really shield against the sharp sound of gun fire.  The only negative is...when there are floor or overhead fans running, the sound of these fans makes it difficult to hear others talk.  If all is quiet except gunfire...they are great.  Any background noise tends to fool the circuitry in the muffs and renders them useless.  However..they do as intended.

He had stopped target shooting the past 3 years due to the percussion sound his regular gun ear protection did not protect him from. A friend ordered these from Amazon and recommended them, so glad he did.  My best friend used these the day of his birthday and then used them the following day, he said they were GREAT!","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2018",D. Benson

Great Accessory Bag - Excellent Quality,5.0,"Purchased a similar product to this from Bagsmart a couple of years ago & loved it.  I'm finding that I need additional space now for all of the electronic accessories I carry when traveling.  Received this product today and found it to be every bit as good as the last, but larger.  Excellent quality, great capacity for everything I carry including cables, chargers, laptop accessories, camera, g.p.s. unit, phone stand etc. Item is well constructed with heavy duty zippers, durable materials.  100% recommended.","January 10, 2019",Steve D.
"Good quality, but onces it's a full bag....",3.0,"It isn't a bad bag.. it's just that when it's full, the sides clinch inside and makes the back look very ""squished""? It has a good amount of pockets and places to put your stuff, but when it gets ""full"" I don't like how the bag basically clinches or compresses itself.","June 13, 2019",Cyrus T.
Great all round bag,4.0,"I currently travel a lot and the bag is great for that as it keeps everything organized. Outside of travelling, I would use it just for storing cables, USB drive, attachments, Fire TV, iPad Air 2 (fits with protective case) cameras, batteries, Bluetooth mouse etc. Really this is a great bag. One thing that I am confused about is the small  SIM, TF, SD marked area inside the cable part of the bag, there is no way to put any card inside that area, however, even if there was I would not store my sim cards in such a small pocket. I would highly recommend this bag for any form of business travel or organization","June 5, 2019",Kelly
JUST RIGHT!,5.0,"Perfect size for organizing home-storage or suitcase-segregation of my small Canon 620SX, and all its gadgets that I travel with (travel-router, backup hdd, batts + dualbatt charger, storagechips and their case, cables. AND maybe also iOS chargers/cables.  AND might carry a lot of complex medications, weekly pilltrays. AND the blue color and material are good. BUT NOT for dslr or bigger-sized anythings.","March 28, 2020",DSH
Premium quality - this review has been updated,4.0,"The material is premium, inside and outside. There is no chemical smell. The tablet compartment fits my iPad Air 2 with gel skin perfectly, with protection on all sides. There are two separate outer zippers, but you have to get used to this (I would often unzip the wrong zipper). UPDATE, WITH ONE STAR DEDUCTED (5 stars to 4 stars): I liked the case so much that I bought a second one, this time in pink (to distinguish the two colours). But this pink-colour case has a strong and awful chemical smell, especially in the upper compartment. I wanted to return it, but I am too busy, so I will just let it go.","November 11, 2017",Downtown Montreal
"Well made, very good bag. Rigid construction.",5.0,"I like this bag but ended up returning as I wasn't a fan of the rigid construction for use in camera backpack. Was looking for something with some flex. However, that being said, it still deserve a high star rating. It is a very well made bag. The organized storage below works great and is handy. Quality materials and a great looking product. If your looking for a rigid formed storage bag, this is a great option.","November 22, 2019",Don Crawford
Just What I Was Looking For!,5.0,"I had a small, desk-side, blue recycling bin that I was using to hold a bunch of electronic parts (travel routers, Apple TV, etc.) and cables that we take out of our trailer when we store it. However, all of the cables get jumbled up so that when you take anything out, half the other things in the bin come out with it. I got tired of that. I went looking for a way to organize these parts and found this travel case. It's perfect. It has lots of places to tuck cables. It also has a larger compartment to hold bigger items like the travel router and the Apple TV. So, everything stays tidy and organized. I'm very happy with this. If I need more space, I can buy bigger versions or two smaller ones. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.","July 24, 2019",Scott Darlington
"Initial review: Bigger than thought, Holds everything nicely",5.0,"So far this is just a first impressions review, just recieved the product today and transferred all my tech into the bag. Design: the product looks like it is a durable sturdy bag, time will tell how the fabric and zippers hold up with being thrown in and out of bags, I do wish the interior had a bright colour to make things easier to find / Stand out more . Size: this bag is large, simple as that. I recently purchased a different bag that was way to small from bagsmart, so when purchasing this one I wanted to make sure I could fit everything into it. And sure enough I could and then some. I have 3x Anker chargers, 6 heavy duty Anker cables, 3 data sticks, 4x AAA, 4xAA, wired headphones, wireless headphones, USB C Hub, portable SSD, 3 SD cards, 2100mah battery pack, Phone controller, ,Xbox controller, Mousepad (in tablet pouch), Mouse & smart watch charger. Uses: I envision this would be a good bag for people going in a trip who wants to carry everyone's charger in one bag, or as a quick grab Go Pro bag, holds your Hub, batteries, Chargers, Cameras and accessories, I think this bag is a little to big to be carrying around in your backpack all day when you fill it to it's potential, it also takes up a bit too much space in that regard as well. I will come back in a month of use to update this review as needed.","November 27, 2019",Keifer M
Does exactly what it should.,4.0,"I bought this because I seem to travel with so many different things these days that need charging and it was such a headache trying to sort all the cords out and make sure I had the right ones.. not to mention they all got tangled when I stuffed them in the same bag/pocket. The bag works really well for keeping all cables and plugs organized, plus there are spots for SIM and SD cards.  It is a little bulkier than I would have preferred, but I take advantage of the extra space by putting a book in the bottom compartment, just in case I get tired of screens. The zippers and material seem to be of a decent quality and have held up well after a month of use.","March 9, 2020",Kristina
Robustesse,5.0,"Produit de belle fabrication, il répond à mes besoins. Quant à la durabilité, j'ai mis un 5 étoiles, car, à première vue, il me paraît résistant et j'ai eu à le surcharger et la fermeture éclair a tenu. Donc, je suppose que ce produit est très résistant.","July 22, 2020",Anne L
"Beautiful organization, zipper sometimes catches",5.0,"Love this bag, it's filled with a variety of cables and small things that I use daily. Charge cables, power banks/bricks, SD cards, thumb drives, etc. Material feels good, the foam separations in the bottom section can be adjusted to allow for a better fit. Zipper sometimes catches on the corner which makes it a little difficult to open at times.","February 10, 2020",Mushrooms
Excellent produit,5.0,"Je suis très satisfait de ce sac de voyage avec un bonne fermeture éclair. Il est composé de deux sections, séparé par un sac central avec rabat. Il est bien divisé, et assez spacieux pour intégrer tous les fils nécessaires pour mes téléphones, les chargeurs, les batteries, les mémoires etc. J'ai fait un bon choix en prenant le plus grand et aussi le plus profond.","December 5, 2018",Serge Campagna
Bonne qualité ! Super utilitaire !,5.0,"Parfait pour mes besoins, j’ai fait rentre tous ce que je veux, par contre je peux garder soit mon i pad air (3ème génération) ou ma caméra Ninon 3200, pas les deux en même temps, pour bien le fermer et que les articles soient sécuritaires. Pour moi c’est correct j’ai un autre étui pour le i pad.","October 16, 2020",Valentina
An amazing bag,5.0,"This bag is amazing. I can pack my laptop power brick,mouse,various USB cables and even my vape batteries. There is still enough room for my compact computer tools as well. I definitely would recommend this bag. Keep in mind it is larger than it looks in the photos but still fits in my backpack with my gaming laptop comfortably.","January 3, 2019",James Glazier
Favourite thing,5.0,"This is turning into my favourite purchase. I can't travel yet, but it's so great for keeping everything organized that I use it everyday now. Deep enough and adaptable for phones, chargers, cables and HD's. Recommend. Blue is a lovely color.","April 15, 2020",Elizabeth Undershute
Zippers broken from day one,1.0,The zippers never functioned properly and split open every time I attempted to zip them shut - as a result the case was more trouble than it was worth and a zip lock bag would have been better and more organized.,"August 16, 2018",Christian
No regrets. The blue is so nice!,5.0,This bag is so nice! It’s functional and very spacious. I don’t really have any complaints. Obviously it’s not the highest quality electronic pouch on the market but the zippers are great. The materials are quality. Especially the outside material of the bag. I recommend it because of the price point. I’d compare it to the quality of Jansport. Won’t regret it.,"May 10, 2020",Jennifer welsh
Perfect Case for Electronics.,5.0,"Excellent bag ! I fill it with 2mts cables (x9 units), 10x USB adapters, DVI adapter, WiFi external NIC, USB to SATA adapter + AC adapter, 2mts HDMI Cable, x100 zip ties, x100 cable ties, and guess what? There’s plenty room still, enough for a external DVD/BD Burner + 72w PD USB charger.","July 13, 2018",Ezequiel Lopez Friscia
Great to keep everything organized,5.0,"This bag holds a lot!  It’s sturdy even for a soft sided case. The fabric is also durable.  We use it to fit all our cables for phones, cameras and tablets when we travel.  It keeps everything so organized.  This bag is a game changer for organization in our suitcase or carryon when we travel.  Love it!","June 11, 2019",Karen
What a travel bag!,5.0,"If you travel and hate losing your electronics wires or searching for sim cards and sd cards at the bottom of your back pack or carry on, this is the travel case for you. I fit a tablet, wires, different memory cards and a small camera. I took it on the plane with me and it kept border checks a breeze but I would have enough confidence to put it in my suitcase. Everything is organized and stays put. I love it!","March 13, 2019",Ms Kiwi
Great for Cochlear Implant organization.,5.0,"We have a daughter with bilateral Cochlear Implants. We use this case to keep her processors, batteries & accessories together in one place. It works very well for organization. Would highly recommend to parents in a similar situation.","April 4, 2020",kale
No case for iPad,3.0,"If you plan on travelling with an iPad using this bag be sure to remove the iPad from it's case (if applicable) as the pouch will NOT accommodate the tablet with a case. iPad mini's should have no problem just the 9.7"" ipad's are the issue","December 29, 2018",Russell Schumacher
Great for organization,5.0,"Love the size of this bag, its the first time I have been able to keep all my electronics and schools supplies together in one bag! Zippers and material feel great and now a bunch of school friends have ordered","June 24, 2020",Amazon Customer
Perfect,5.0,"It's everything it promised to be, just as illustrated in the description.  Great quality and oh so handy to keep all my cables and electronic equipment organized. Exactly what I was looking for, and then some.","May 7, 2020",ecmisera
Good case,5.0,"I like the size and flexible layout of this travel case and I'm sure it will have more then enough room for all of my cables and tech gear. Unfortunately the space for the tablet is not larger enough for my iPad pro 10.5"" with its case on, I think the iPad would fit without the case but I'd rather not take the case off.","August 17, 2018",Fallguy
Keeps everything in Its Place While Travelling!,5.0,"Essential to keep all your electronics gear, wires, chargers, etc. organized.  Seems well made and durable.  Somewhat pricey but it is a quality product so...  Recommended.","August 7, 2020",GeoKs
Perfect case for travel,5.0,I ordered this case to take away on vacation because I hate having all of our cords/headphones etc everywhere. This was perfect. It held all of our cords perfectly as well as 2 ipads and 2 e readers. I would definitely recommend this. I carried an oversize purse and I was able to put it in it instead of my carry on luggage on my way down and my husband just carried it on our way back. That way it didn't have to put in the bin above us and could access it on the plane no problem.,"February 28, 2019",Tanya
great for roadtrips on motorcycle,5.0,"Great little bag for everything I need on a motorcycle trip.  Holds my usb power bar and all the cables I need for Scala, phones, GoPro for when we get to hotels. Even enough room for some GoPro accessories and fits easily in back compartment of touring bike along with my other baggage.","August 28, 2019",Cathy
Very very useful!,5.0,"We've taken 1 trip with it so far and couldn't be happier. There are more than enough pockets for all the cables that belong to all the electronics that it carries. The flexible compartment dividers is brilliant! The only thing it doesn't carry is our phones, but that's ok because we want to carry them on ourselves. Highly recommend!!!","September 10, 2020",S Jackson
Great size,5.0,I love the case!! It for many of my cords and external hard drives as well as my MacBook mouse. I even have room left. It’s well made and I expect it to last. I only just received it and if I feel at a later time it doesn’t stand my five stars I will make it a point to revise my review. I do recommend this case.,"April 2, 2020",David and Tara
Great travel bag,5.0,I am going to be traveling for the next 6 months and so I bought thus bag to organize all my electronics. I am very impressed with the organization of this bag and how much fits in it. It's also really well made and great quality. Would definitely buy it again,"April 16, 2019",Keri Mullin

Very Handy case,5.0,"I love this case! I like to be very organized and this case is just the ticket! All my electronic accessories are all in one place now and not all over the place, in my car when I travel, in my purse, in my suitcase! I now know where everything is. Thinking of buying one to use as a bathroom / make up bag for travel. Not sure it would work, though!","August 11, 2019",Yvonne Jackman

Good product but could be better,3.0,"Good quality for the price, quite spacious inside. Would be nice to see a bit more substantial cushioning for protecting fragile items and also a few more removable dividers for better space management of the main compartment.","November 29, 2017",Ayon Mitra

Light and bright,5.0,"Very comfortable for making to do notes . Light weight , easy writing with stylus. Quick erase using one button . Display is pretty good and does not hurt your eyes. Recommended if you need to write quick notes or use for rough work.","October 30, 2019",Mr AA
slim and easy to write on,5.0,"Working from home, sometime you need to write a few things down. I want an environment friendly way instead of writing it on a piece of paper every time so I bought this. So far it doesn’t disappoint. It is lightweight and slim. It is smooth to write on, easy to erase. It has a magnet at the back if you want to stick it somewhere.","March 27, 2020",I love shopping
Good upgrade from paper,5.0,"In my line of work I do a lot of notes, I pretty much always has a piece of paper beside me, and this helped me a lot to reduce clutter and of course paper. The device is really responsive and light weight, quite convenient. It has a couple of issues like I can't adjust the intensity/brightness of the writing so don't expect to be super readable if you have the lights off, and the material feels like a cheap plastic, but overall it gets the job done","August 15, 2020",ChinoChico
J'adore!!,5.0,"J'adore! Sérieux j'en veux d'autres. Je dis ça comme ça, c'est bientôt Noël et j'ai été sage :) Mon utilisation : prendre des notes pendant mes rencontres.

Light to carry and saves you a lot!,5.0,"I received the package yesterday and it was just as I expected small and light to carry around. I bought this tablet to do some calculations on it, as a student and a person who does a lot of calculations I was wasting a lot of paper. But by buying this I I will save so much money which I would have spent on papers.","March 20, 2020",Tofik
Decent but..,3.0,Magnets are very weak and slides off the fridge pretty easy. The pen is kind of annoying to get out. Have to take it off the fridge to get apart and that’s if it doesn’t fall down from the weak magnets.,"July 23, 2020",T
Got it for my brother for Scrap Work,5.0,"I got this for my little brother as an incentive to write things down during online classes.

My brother likes it which means I like it too","September 10, 2020",Amy
Helpful,5.0,"Good product for drawing some random sketch, writing down some information, show some calculations etc. Very easy to use. Just press the button and everything Will be erased. Also can be put on the refrigerator to write down some listings. Comes with a pen.","June 24, 2020",Sunny J
Good for notes,5.0,"Display is pretty much wide and good. I have attached this display to my fridge, so whenever some grocery items are missing I can write it down.

Can't Beat this Carry-All!,5.0,"In the bottom section, I was able to fit in an external hard-drive, external voice recorder, portable charger, 6 AAA batteries, 4 packs of Lithium 2032's, 4 packs of camera SD cards, and my phone plug AND there is room to spare. In the top section I was able to fit 5 charger cables, 2 10-ft USB2go cables and some miscellaneous small items AND have room to spare.  It's still only 4"" high, 6-I/2"" deep, and 9"" wide. The handle will allow me to pop this sideways into my under-seat airplane personal item and still have easy access to everything.","February 27, 2020",Kate
Great bags,4.0,"Love the bags.  Great for all sorts of size objects, from tablets and their cables/chargers, to camera and wires, to a go pro look alike with all its attachments/brackets.  Gave one to family member to keep his own stuff organized and he can see what he is missing as he is now absolutely and completely responsible for the stuff in that bag.  If he loses it, it is now wholly his fault.  The bags are lightweight, love the ability to use the velcro pieces to create holders of various sizes.  Little pockets and the elastic straps really hold the memory card cases, cords, etc. all in place.  Easy to see if there is something missing.  Happy : )","March 1, 2020",Bobby
I really needed one of these,5.0,Love it! I’m about to go on an 8 month backpacking trip taking only a carry on size backpack so I’m going to be “packing cubing” everything so I maximize space and organization and this “tech bag” is exactly what I needed.

I carry: laptop charger, camcorder charger, camera charger, 4 iPhone chargers, 2 mini USB chargers, ear buds, and various little add-ons (like fitbit charger, USB converter, key fob camera, etc.).

Fantastic purchase. Great quality and holds a LOT!,5.0,"I bought one of these for myself, used it for a few months and loved it so much I bought another as a gift for my husband. These are quality organizers and are well-constructed. Mine still looks like new even after months of use. I really appreciate that the sides are stiffer fabric and hold their shape well. The medium size fits a LOT of gadgets and cords. I was able to pack several usb cables, a 3DS charger, headphone cables and splitter, a Samsung bluetooth speaker, a 20000mAh battery pack and my 3DS with room to spare.

What I mean is with other electronics organizers, the flat panels are hard enough to protect the electronics inside, however the side seems can be compressed. With these, the side panels are as stiff as the flat panels making compression impossible.

A really great case for the price look at all the zippered pockets,5.0,This case is really excellent.

Look at other cases around with a similar price and you won't see the same thing.,"September 4, 2019",Kevin Parker
Quality,5.0,"No complaints. Well-made. I would have personally preferred velcro straps over the five zipper pockets, but if the zippers continue to hold from daily use as they are now, i have no real complaints.

,,"Bigger than expected (don't often get to say that). Should have paid closer attention to details. No detriment to the item itself, which is very useful for a longer trip or more gear. It is however rather bulky so if you're looking simply to keep a couple if cables, a charger and battery pack safe and in order, you might find something smaller more suitable. I can fit in headphones, charging cables for phone, aux lead, battery pack lead and large battery pack, torch, phone charger and socket adapter without problem. The zip isn't amazing but is ok and the hardshell provides some padding for equiptment.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 2, 2020",Dot

,,"Ich nutze das Case für Sticks, Kabel, Stecker, Adapter und ein kleines Wischtuch. Es dient mir dabei, diese kleinen Utensilien, die für mich als DJ wichtig sind, kompakt zu halten. Das Case ist stabil gebaut und wirkt robust - wie es sich über längere Zeit verhält bleibt abzuwarten. Verarbeitung sieht gut aus und Style ist hübsch. Durch die harte Außenhülle ist es schwierig das Case etwas zu überladen bzw. zu stopfen. Wenn die Seitenfächer voll sind, bleibt kaum Raum, in der Mittelwand noch Dinge, die leicht auftragen unterzubringen, da diese Wand direkt auf dem Reißverschluss der tieferen Seitenabteile aufliegt. Meiner Meinung nach hätte man das Case minimal dicker gestalten müssen, damit zwischen Trennwand und den Seitenabteilen noch etwas Luft ist. Im Prinzip kann ich nur die Seitenfächer nutzen. Ich war so schnell an der Kapazitätsgrenze und musste etwas quetschen.","Reviewed in Germany on February 14, 2020",Bitte_Danke_Gerne

,,"I can see how some people will find this case too big or bulky. However (for my needs) this is perfect, and most importantly, very protective. The padding is very nice inside as well. I can confidently know that if I accidentally drop this, my stuff will be protected. I also like how they added a hand strap... it has a nice texture to it and it feels very secure to the bag itself (you cannot remove the hand strap, however). Surprisingly, the company’s logo is nowhere to be found on the outer part of the case. Rather, it’s found in a small spot on the inside of the case. This is a small observation, but I can imagine some people will be happy with this decision if they don’t like logos showing. For reference, I have a 21000mAh portable battery bank , 5 charging cables (of various sizes), and a 30W USB-C wall charger. I like how I was able to easily fit these items in this case; I tried to do this with this company’s folding accessories pouch, but it wouldn’t fold properly with all those items inside. The middle flap can be secured with the small velcro strap that’s inside. I actually love this design since I made it so my primary items that I need right away are in plain view right when I open the case. My other stuff that I rarely need is on the other side, where the velcro is securing the flap. In conclusion, I highly recommend this to someone who doesn’t mind a bulky accessories case who wants to make sure their stuff stays protected wherever they go; for someone who doesn’t mind having an all black design who doesn’t need a colorful case. The build quality is really exceptional for the price you’re paying. I can tell that this company took the time to make sure they made a good case that would be great for someone like me. Thank you.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2019",JayySur
,,"This thing is big and bulky.  Like, really big and bulky.  It takes up more than 1/2 a backpack.  It's not convenient.  Yet, relative to it's size, it doesn't hold much.  It has a bunch of ""pockets"" for organization, but they really hinder the case from storing more than 3 items.  If the items you are trying to store are thicker than 1/4 inch, and you add more than a few items, the case can't close.  I bought this for an international trip to store and organize all of the A/V stuff we would need for the airplane and it was a bust.  We brought multiple audio splitters and auxiliary batteries -- and the case was overloaded and wouldn't zip.  The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it is a sturdy case.  It will keep those 3 items that actually fit really safe and protected.","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2019",Sarah Byrnes

Interior has a useful insert panel with 2 mesh pockets and 2 zippers pockets for charging accessories.  Each interior wall has full zipper pockets for the solar charger and enough room for the charging plug.  The other is the same size. Lovely.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2020",REF

"Durable, light and beautiful!",5.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. We bought this for our baby who will soon start crawling, but our 4yo loves it! We do too! I like the fact it rolls instead of folding, because by reading other reviews, those that fold don’t seem to last as much. The village pattern is beautiful and it’s a toy on itself. And the neutral pattern allows us to play with other toys without too much information from the other side. It’s easy to wipe clean it. It is soft and comfortable and there’s enough grip for our baby to crawl on it. It is also very light and I can easily move from one room to another or to the living room and use the neutral side and no one will even notice it’s meant for children. It seem durable too. Our baby keeps scratching his nails against it and no damage so far. I have tried to scratch it with my nails too and so far so good! Pretty happy with this purchase!","July 7, 2020",Raíssa Queiroz
Beautiful Baby Mat,4.0,"This baby mat is absolutely beautiful! It's versatile, with a whimsical/artistic road map print on one side and a neutral gray pattern on the other side. I can see my baby still playing on the road map print with his own vehicles later on after he's mastered crawling on it. The neutral print side also lets me use it as a substitute for the living room rug. Material is nice and cushioned - my mom slept on this for a few nights when the doctor told her she had to lie on the floor to realign her back, she said it was cushioned enough to sleep on. Note the generous sizing of the mat and make sure you have space for it, I can see this being an issue for those with smaller spaces. This mat takes up a good chunk of my play room. Material is easy to clean, but slippery. You won't slip on it (unless you're running with socks) but my baby is learning to crawl right now and and the lack of grip makes it hard for him to push himself up and forward.","March 18, 2019",DealQueen
Pleasantly surprised!,4.0,Wow I'm so surprised with the quality of this! I was expecting a gym mat but this is something totally special! Unfortunately there was a stain on mine (pictured) I would return if I bought in the store but too much of a Hassel to pack it back up and ship it back.,"February 4, 2019",Alexis Zornio
Best investment for children!!!,5.0,"I cannot express how much I am in love with this mat. At first I thought it was a bit pricey for a play mat. Now I think it is the best investment I made for my LO. The mat is thick enough (about 1/2 inch) and is pretty large. My daughter is 6 months and rolling all over the place since I got the mat. She lovesssss tummy time and loves to play freely on the mat. It is great to encouraged tummy time as the mat has beautiful images to look at, great soft feel so you don’t have to worry much to let them explore and bump their head sometimes. She’s almost 7 months not and so close to crawling. Even daddy comes to play with us on the mat and gives us plenty of space to play safely. And an added bonus, flip it over for company and they would never know it’s a playmat for babies. I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone with infants. Great great great!","April 30, 2019",Amazon Customer
"Awesome, large and good looking playmat",5.0,"Love this playmat. It’s a great large size, wipeable east to clean with pets and kids. Our dogs nails have cut into it a couple times but it doesn’t gouge / get holes.  it’s a nice design for kids and not tacky. We have two, one in baby’s room and one in our living room that we can reverse to chevron side for a more classy look. Big enough and Comfortable for adults to get down on the floor to play / crawl with kids as well!","July 12, 2019",nadine
great mat. came with a stain and dent,3.0,amazing mat. my baby can lay on it and feel comfortable eveb on ceramic floor. very thick compared to other mats I bought very annoyed that upon opening this there was a stain / dent in the product.  for the price I am disappointed it arrived damaged.,"July 20, 2020",tiffany
Not a very good mat,3.0,"This was a very bad mat in my opinion.  It never unrolled flat no matter how I unrolled it the other way. The thickness is more like half a centimeter.  I have the ""babycare"" playmat and the description stated the same dimensions in thickness.  It is definitely not!  The Babycare mat is so much better!  On top of this, when barefoot..it feels very sticky like walking on plastic bubble wrap.  So that makes it feel very cold as well.  Not intended for hardwood floor.  I am returning this item. The print is very cute though.","June 20, 2020",LLTP
Tapis pour bébé,5.0,"Tapis choisi pour sa sécurité ( pas d'émanation toxique contrairement aux tuiles qui s'emboîtent). Très satisfaite, se nettoie facilement, bébé peut être sur le dos ou en ventral sans problème, assez épais pour qu'un adulte assis soit confortable. Se replis facilement pour passer l'aspirateur ou faire de la place. Le temps le dira pour la durabilité.","July 11, 2019",Client d'Amazon
Quality is not as good as the looking,3.0,"Before buying, I noticed that some users mentioned the material of this mat is easy to be tore, while I thought maybe if I use it carefully it should be ok. Turns out, even we only put the baby and baby boys on it, for some reason the mat is still broken and it shows the foam inside!!! Also, my baby starts crawling now, his arm is often stuck on the mat because the material creates some sort of suction on bear skin in warm weather, not pleasant. The gray color fades off as well. I took the pictures showing one spot but there are multiple spots. I like it a lot because the looking is very nice but won’t buy it again.","June 11, 2020",Christina
Way too thin and poor quality.,3.0,I really liked this mat when I first got it. The colours and patterns are super cute and it covers a large area. I needed another mat in a smaller size and bought a baby care mat. The baby care is WAY more cushioned than the skip hop. The skip hop one has basically no cushioning and you can feel to the other side of it easily. The baby care one actually has some sort of layer of cushioning and you cannot feel your fingers through the other side. I wish I had paid a bit more for the bigger baby care mat instead of spending less and getting poor quality. I also have has several squares rip off easily. It’s not the most durable if you have pets.,"July 29, 2020",Lila
Vibrant Village Play Mat,4.0,"I bought this for my 7 month old granddaughter after our daughter had mentioned that she would like a play mat for the baby to play on  As I have not had to research this item before, I left it up to my daughter to choose and also had a recommendation from a friend of hers.  I like the fact that it rolls up, not folds like an accordian.  We have only had it a couple of weeks and I can honestly say that it is super cute and the sizing is perfect. I can see how it can get damaged from animals or sharp toys rubbing along the mat.  There is no avoiding that unless you keep EVERYTHING off of it - but then what is the point.  So my concern is that, for the price,  I had not expected it to be made in China.  I had gone into a chain store and they sell similar mats, the size is just a tad smaller, also made in China but at less than half price of what this one cost.  Therefore, do your research.  For the amount of time the child is going to be on it - you don't have to spend a fortune because in my mind, they are all very similar.","December 16, 2019",Terri Joosten
Awesome playmat.,5.0,My baby loves playing on this mat. He’s crawling all over it and enjoying the bright and fun images. We love the setup and how it’s so easy to clean. Love the reversible side that it’s grey for a more understated look. Also went with this one piece rollaway vs the foam pieces because our kid won’t be able To tear it apart.,"March 7, 2019",kikolena
Love the pattern and color!,5.0,"This is the second play mat that I purchased for my daughter. The first one is from babycare. Have to say this one is much lighter and not as thick as the other. The babycare one is more condensed, but this one is more bouncy and you can feel the cushion. Personally I think both are pretty safe and can protect the baby. Pricewise this is more reasonable. For the color and pattern design I like this one better. The contrast of the color caught my baby’s attention she loves to look at the pattern and play on the mat. Very happy of the purchase.","October 23, 2020",J
Arrived with yellow discoloration,1.0,I am extremely disappointed with how this product arrived as it has a VERY large discolored section that is yellow. For the price and the brand this is extremely disappointing and a hassle. I will say that other than it being discolored it seems to be a pretty good mat. It's a little thinner than I thought it would be but still has a good cushion to it. I'm sure my little one will be fine if she falls on the mat. I'm in the process of exchanging the mat. Will update review according to the condition of the replacement.,"August 19, 2020",Breanne
Worth every penny!,5.0,"This mat is pricey compared to another playmat we've purchased. I wanted to see the difference, and boy was I pleased with my purchase! It is way cushier than cheaper mats, the images are fun and compliment a modern living space. Having the less ""kid like"" side allows for nicer look if in your living room (which ours is). The size is also great! Big enough for 2 kids and an adult to play on comfortably. I've been using it as a work out spot too and it's been amazing! Baby stuff is expensive, but this is something we use every single day and will continue to use for years (planning to move it into kids room once he's old enough) Worth the money compared to other short-lived expensive baby items!","January 12, 2020",Katie Grassie
Ink Splat on both sides of the mat,2.0,"I purchased this for my baby to practice her tummy time and for regular play. The mat is a good size and the material was quite nice. There was no smell upon taking it out of the package. However, the mat is quite thin. Also, I was also disappointed in that the paint/coloring smudged when the mat was made, so there were multiple noticeable ink splat. It didn't look appealing at all. I requested a replacement and the second mat also had the ink splat. I wasn't impressed.","June 5, 2019",Janet Gu
Love it,5.0,"Worth every penny, such a nice comfy Matt for our baby to play on. Great for learning to crawl. 10/10 the foam is good quality ! Love this Matt! Hit helpful if this was helpful","June 4, 2020",Anon123
Wish we bought sooner,5.0,"Great size mat. I thought it would have been slightly thicker but it still seems padded enough for my little one who’s still learning to sit, keep his balance etc. The colours and images of the village are nice and seem to entertain my little guy. It’s easy to clean And is the one piece so dirt can’t hide anywhere which was key in my decision to buy. Glad we finally purchased this.","November 5, 2019",Sammut
Good mat,4.0,"I order this mat for my little one. What I love about this mat is, it’s universal. The one side is used for the little one to play on and the other is just a simple design.. Once when my little one gets older. I can re use the other side of the mat to put in a spare bedroom or somewhere in the house. Reason why I give 4 star is because it’s kinda thin. I had to put a area rug under it so my little one’s head don’t bang..","December 29, 2019",Tee
Cute but falling apart after 2 months,2.0,"I like this mat because its super cute and reversible. I hesitated to buy it because of the price, but finally decided to go for it. I'm extremely disappointed that it had a split in it after only a few months! It doesn't effect the function of it much but just a bummer considering the price point.","December 5, 2019",elizabeth Smeltzer
Must have for baby!,5.0,"A must have for baby! Very spacious, definitely gives them a lot of room to play around on. I love how foamy it is, makes me feel more confident that he won’t hurt himself if he happens to slip backwards while sitting. I can’t speak much in durability because I’ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but I have a 100lb dog who walks on it without leaving a mark. 10/10 recommend!","May 28, 2020",Brittany Picton
It turned my baby into a little speedster!,5.0,"I love this mat! It’s super comfy and so far very durable.. I have 2 cats and they haven’t tried to tear it apart yet! I adore the city print it’s just so whimsical and fits in with our decor.. Love that it’s double sided so if I do get tired of it I can flip it over. But most important, my baby loves crawling around on it.. definitely worth every penny!","February 26, 2020",Stephie G
"Easy to clean, excellent quality",5.0,"I love this play mat ! I waited for it to be on sale as it is pretty expensive... I do not regret buying it ! I was thinking at first I would only use the grey and white side, but my baby loves the colorful patterns and I use it on the colorful side as well ! Black and white designs catch baby's eye !","April 25, 2019",Amazon Customer
Cute and functional. Kids love it!,5.0,"Amazing play mat. We've had it for almost a year and it still looks brand new. Easy to clean and provides a soft surface for my little one to lay down and fall down on. Don't put anything on it that can puncture the surface - a chair was put on it with a sharp spot and there is a small tear, but it hasn't torn further or affected the use. Great product - I have recommended this to a bunch of friends.","December 1, 2019",sassasasha
Cute design,5.0,I decided to purchase this mat over foam puzzles. It won't fall apart  or break easily. It is easy to clean and waterproof. Love that there are two designs (clouds and polka dots). I like this as it is easy on the eyes and not too colourful - blends well with my decor in some way.,"May 30, 2019",Mary
"Not too hard, not too soft, goldilocks' play mat.",5.0,"This play mat is exactly what we had in mind. It has two sides. The fun play time one and the ""I am a sophisticated adult"" one. The mat is very squishy and comfy for dad to roll around on and play with baby. Baby seems to like it. Cat claws could prove detrimental, but haven't yet after a couple months.","August 26, 2020",William Barth
Will puncture if you have larger dogs,4.0,Love the pattern and wipe clean ability. I bought this for my daughter because of the versatility as she grows as my friend has one and loves it however she has small dogs and I have a Boxer and a German Shepherd who unfortunately punctured the mat the very first day it was down. With the punctured side liquid does seep in and cause discoloring so that is disappointing as I was hoping it would be more durable to everyday living but otherwise it’s been great as my daughter has been learning to stand & walk to cushion her tumbles a bit and I look forward to her being able to enjoy the road map side when she’s a little older,"October 9, 2018",Jaylin
Super impressed! 5 stars!,5.0,"Super happy with the quality of this mat! It has a great design, it’s thick and super easy to clean even scrubbing the mat the image isn’t wrecked! It rolls up great for easy storage! It’s quit large as well! I have recommended it to all my baby mama friends!","October 3, 2020",Jimmy Byrne
Already ripped in less then 2 months,1.0,I am disappointed that this has ripped in less then 2 months.  I have to keep it flipped on the blue side so my daughter doesn't eat the inside parts of the grey and white side.  Is there any warranty on these carpets? Any assistance from the company would be great!,"August 26, 2020",Johnathon
Great mat,5.0,"The mat is exactly what I was looking for. It's a great size, soft enough to prevent bumps when my little guy topples over, it stays in place, and has a bit of texture allowing for easy crawling (we have hardwood which is too slippery). Although it cost more than I was hoping for, it was totally worth it.","April 15, 2020",Suzy M.
Highly recommend,5.0,"We love this mat! My son loves to explore and look at all the different characters and colours. We don’t use the other side much, but it’s perfect to roll out in our living room for our son and friends too play on. Our dog walks on it as well, and I find it’s pretty durable.","March 29, 2020",jobro79
Perfect for what it does,5.0,"Great buy. We use it in the baby’s playroom. We love that it’s super easy to clean, and comfy as well. The only drawback I’ve seen is that since it has a bit of a plastic feel to it, it feel cool to the touch compared to rugs or blankets, so in winter I add a blanket between the baby and the rug. We only use the colored side for the playroom. Because of the texture, I’m not sure if could ever pass as « adult rug » even on the less colored side.","January 4, 2020",Aya
Super pretty and large,5.0,I love it and I would buy again. Super beautiful and playful for children and easy to clean for mom. The flip side can be great if you are looking for a more neutral design that fits your loving room. I would definitely buy again.,"May 10, 2020",Elena D
Great size and easy to clean,5.0,Beautiful design and perfect size for my living room. Makes a good back drop for photos too. Soft and cushioned. Non slip backing. I use it on my hardwood floors though. Not sure about carpet. Easy to clean,"July 24, 2019",Julia
Good but slight defect,4.0,Received my play mat today and was very excited to open it up. It is exactly as shown and seems very durable. My only complaint is that it came with some of the edges slightly yellowed. The mat is a bright white but some edges have yellowed. Not sure how it could have happened. It's definitely noticeable but not annoying enough for me to return. I bought it for our new baby coming in March but my 3 year old was very excited about the road pattern!,"December 2, 2019",Caley
Great purchase!,5.0,"These are great and much better than the tiles mat. They don't slip and baby doesn't get to ""destroy"" the foam mat like she would do with the tiles (she takes them apart). A lot more cushier also and the walker goes easier over it than the tiles mat.","December 20, 2019",timamzelle
Great play mat,5.0,So far it’s been easy to clean. I can’t talk about the durability yet as baby has started using it 2 weeks ago but skip hop’s quality never disappointed us in the past! The mat is perfect size and we really like the colours. It feels quite comfortable and it’s not too soft nor hard.,"October 3, 2020",Johnny
Have it boxed by Amazon!,3.0,Lovely! But came delivered in a plastic bag that was ripped and the mat was exposed to who knows what. Whipped it down and turned the cloth black. Great product! ... and three months later i found that there was a rip.,"April 9, 2020",Elaine
Graphic transfers off the mat. Hazard to baby?,1.0,"This product is concerning to me. It’s made for children yet the graphic transferred off onto another part of the mat. I haven’t even used it yet... it came like this. SOOO frustrating and disappointing. I’m too busy with my baby to go through the hassle of returning it. Should have bought a different brand. NOT impressed. If the graphic was so easy to transfer, could this be a risk to my baby if she touches her mouth to it??","October 6, 2020",Mya
Great playmat,5.0,"This product is as described and great for the play area. It's great quality and well made, we love the fact that it's also reversible! Very easy to clean and put away as well when not needed.","September 3, 2020",Sherrylyn
Colour is off but otherwise a good mat,3.0,"From the picture the mat looked light and dark grey on the back side. Sadly in real life it’s cream and light grey. Not what I was expecting! It already has one small hole in it so curious how it will hold up over time. Otherwise I like the pattern side, the cushion and the size.","December 11, 2019",Bobbi Piche

Comfortable and Classic!,5.0,This is the second mat we purchased - we loved our first one so much we had to get another for our front room! Makes playing on our hardwood floors comfortable and easy for both baby and parents :) The fact it’s reversible is wonderful!

Not what I expected.,2.0,"I ordered these for my daughter and her best friend. Unfortunately, I didn't read everything properly. They are not typical hoodie material, they are made with the stuff that is super lightweight, tends to feel weird to touch. Some people are okay with it, some aren't. Very upset about that because they haven't even worn them. As for the fit, they are true to size. They are really cute. Just crappy material. And unfortunately they were tossed in the wash beforehand, so I can't even return them.","November 14, 2020",Michelle Dee

I would buy the Rotibox Music Beany again,4.0,"I bought this product so I could listen to music while walking our dog in cold weather.  In most respects, I am delighted. The stereo speakers connect easily to my smart phone via blue tooth, the sound quality is far better than I would have expected given the cost, and the hat is comfortable, warm and, to my mind, stylish. There is however a problem that arises out of the design -  the electronics are housed in a unit that sits in a pouch behind a leatherette square and the controls are operated sight unseen through the leatherette. Since the unit slides around a bit relative to the leatherette, it is hard to know which button you are pushing. it means that getting the unit started and stopped is a hit and miss affair and can take a few minutes. A workaround: plug and unplug the charger cable until the unit starts or stops. Again, I am delighted with my purchase, and would order it again, but don't be surprised by controls that are a bit frustrating.","December 31, 2017",David Cornfield

Not a touque At all,2.0,"This is a beautiful hat, other than it really is a scarf, or rather a neck warmer,  not a hat.  I was so disappointed when I opened the bag (which was beautifully wrapped) and found that in order to make this item a true ""hat"" you must pull the elastic draw cord and tighten it at the top.  Even then it doesn't pull to completely seal the top of the hat.  It would make a good ponytail hat I suppose?","December 5, 2017",TA

,,"Bluetooth Beanie Hat Scarf = Not a traditional closed hat.  It's more of a neck warmer style that you could wear as a hat, which is not what I was expecting based on the photos & description. The material is good quality that seems like it will keep you toasty warm & it came with a mini usb charging cable that is approx. 19 inches long. Over all it seems very nice, I really like the dark slate gray color (photos are a bit lighter due to flash) I just wish it was a traditional closed hat vs. neck warmer/""hat"".","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2016",Shopping Ninja
,,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. We had already purchased and returned two similar products because of poor sound quality and not fitting (too big). He really likes this one, though! says the sound quality is really good. It's good with music on his phone as well as streaming sites. It is still a little big, so if he pulls it all the way down on his head, the speakers are at his ear lobes, rather than directly on his ears. He also says it is very warm. It's easy to charge. I'll leave an updated review once we try removing the electronics and washing it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020",cnfox21
,,"Color and style is great. Sound quality good and it's great to be able to not have something sticking in my ears for a change and yet be able to be on the phone or listen to music, and still be aware of the sounds around me. The only challenge was that the two speakers on either side are kind of high on my ears so I kept pulling down the hat trying to stretch it out so that I could get the speakers right where I want them. I'm going to keep stretching out the hat until I get the desired fit but overall these are a neat invention and useful, and the hat is warm.","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2017",ANAGEV
,,"Eh. Had to order another speaker because it broke within a week. They sent me one free of charge though, pretty okay customer service. But the reason I don't like it is because it's small, tight, heavy and thick. It gets really hot and constraining. This was my fault for not reading but it also has a huge hole in the middle that you have to close yourself with a string, makes it stressful to constantly close it because it contstanly opens up itself because it won't fit right on my head. I'm an adult female too. Not too big or small of head","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2018",Mya
,,"they are ok, maybe i am just too small for this hat or something, but in order to hear what the person on the other end of my call was saying, i would have to press the ear flaps down to really smoosh against my ear.  The range is decent and my phone never lost connection with it though.  Maybe for music it is ok, but for phone use, not so much since its too quiet.  The person on the other end could hear me though.  For reference, im a small woman.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2017",Raidou K

,,"After 2.5 months of gentle use, one speaker no longer works. I can still use it as a hat, and can somewhat use for sound. If this was a 5 to 10 dollar device I'd not feel so bad. But for the price it didn't even come close to lasting a season. Don't bother. Go elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2019",Smash
,,"I loved this. The fit was perfect, I looked cute, the sound quality was entirely acceptable. But I had to return it because the speaker placement didn't match my ears and they aren't moveable. Sad! I got the headband style that Rotibox offers and it's just as good.","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2019",Chris Wilson
,,"I'll get a lot of use out of this.  It doesn't sound as good as my Sony bluetooth headphones, but it's very comfortable and convenient.  For shorter walks I'll wear this and maybe for urban hikes I'll wear the other headphones.","Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2019",Christopher Cortese
,,"The beanie itself is of nice quality and warm. The size is fine, you must have a very large head if this does not fit you. I did have to open the beanie to adjust the speakers so that I could use the buttons. Even after, it's hard to find a fit where the speakers sit on both your ears. The sound is similar to holding computer speakers to your head. Pretty loud, so loud in fact I hurt my ear the first time I messed around and stuck one of the speakers on my ear at full blast. Be careful when adjusting sound or you will do what I did. Overall, the beanie seems cool. Just don't do what I did and mess up your ear for a few days.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2017",Spencer B.

Sturdy and Solid Case in the toughest of situations,5.0,We bought this case to keep our DJI Osmo Action camera safe and secure on the boat when we take kids out fishing. It really has kept the camera protected while we have tossed it around on the boat and not a dent or ding in it.  We will definitely be looking to get more of these and cases for our other drone and camera equipment Pros: - Sturdy - Good Padding - Tight and secure clasps - Good seal for water protection - Stands up well to being out in the hot sun Cons: - Hinges could be a bit thicker gauge wire,"June 24, 2020",KidsOutFishing
Good First Impressions,4.0,"Through some home testing, the cases floats, and seems water tight. Not Pelican Case quality. Haven't received my cam yet, but cutouts seem accurate.  Some minor manufacturing defects on the outside of the case, perhaps from the mold?  Would prefer to have a little more padding in the bottom.  Bottom and top padding are both glued in place. O-ring can come out, though it is not a smooth surface, and could potentially let water in.  I might replace it. Not bad for the price, I guess","April 5, 2020",Monty Janes
Almost perfect!,4.0,"Bought this for my new DJI Osmo Action, and it's almost perfect...only thing I had to do was cut out one of the holes larger to fit the battery charger, as the non-DJI brand doesn't fit. Other than that, it's solid, nice snug fit for everything so it won't bounce around, and it's small and light weight for travel. Haven't tested the waterproofness of it yet but it's like a Pelican case so should be good.","April 8, 2020",Amazon Customer

,,"I ordered a Lekufee Small Waterproof Hard Case for DJI Osmo Action Camera and a Lekufee large case for my DJI Mavic Air 2 drone.  I like to buy quality items and (I know, call me weird) items that are from the same manufacturer that look similar.  After much research I opted for these 2 items.  The drone case is VERY nice and sturdy, it is made out of a nice plastic material.  In contrast, this Osmo Action case is made out of a material that seems very similar to one of the big clear plastic storage totes you can buy at any big box store that seems to last about 6 months before something breaks on it.  Probably not a big deal, but all the photos show the foam removed so you can just put your Osmo Action right in and walk away.  It comes with all foam in place and you have to remove the pieces you need to in order to fit what you want.  I guess this could be a plus for some people, but I was looking for a custom case I could just use right out of the box and not have to worry about removing a piece of foam I wish I wouldn't have.  I am returning this case and will be looking for something a little nicer to protect my investment.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2020",JEFF
,,"My DJI Fits perfect, feels a little on the cheap side i wouldnt want to drop it in fear it would break, tho i believe it would still protect the camera in that scenario . as far as Water proof or resistance i cannot offer my opinion on such as i received it yesterday and has not nor will it ever come near Water to find out lol if your DJI needs a case this does the job , only gripe is its not big enough for the selfie stick and tripod that came in the bundle i bought","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2020",RodderFiles
